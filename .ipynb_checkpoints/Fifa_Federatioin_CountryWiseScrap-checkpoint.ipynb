       "   'content': \"Syria close in on early progression with fifth straight win\\nUzbekistan, Turkmenistan move top of their respective groups\\nQualifying action in Asia will resume in March\\nIt was a night of mixed results for the group leaders entering Tuesday's sixth matchday of Asia's second round qualifying for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar™. Syria opened up an eight-point gap in Group A with a fifth straight qualifying victory against Philippines to move closer to early progression to the next stage, while Qatar maintained their solitary-point lead with a 1-0 victory against Afghanistan.\\nIraq and Vietnam, however, failed to reinforce their position at the top of Groups C and G respectively, following draws against Thailand and Bahrain. Despite those results, they remain at the summit of their respective groups.\\nElsewhere, Uzbekistan bounced back to restore their place at the top of Group D following a 2-0 win over Palestine and fellow Central Asians Turkmenistan moved to the top of Group H with victory against Sri Lanka.\\nJoin FIFA.com as we take a closer look at the action across the continent.Matchday 6 results (19 November)\\nGroup A: Maldives 3-1 Guam, Syria 1-0 Philippines\\nGroup B: Nepal 0-1 Kuwait, Jordan 5-0 Chinese Taipei\\nGroup C: Hong Kong 2-0 Cambodia, Iraq 0-0 Bahrain\\nGroup D: Yemen 1-2 Singapore, Uzbekistan 2-0 Palestine\\nGroup E: Afghanistan 0-1 Qatar, Oman 1-0 India\\nGroup F: Myanmar 1-0 Mongolia, Kyrgyz Republic 1-1 Tajikistan\\nGroup G: Malaysia 2-0 Indonesia, Vietnam 0-0 Thailand\\nGroup H: Turkmenistan 2-0 Sri Lanka, Lebanon 0-0 Korea DPRThe match\\nMalaysia 2-0 Indonesia (Rasid 30', 73')\\nOn a day of few surprises, it was Malaysia's 2-0 home win against Indonesia in Group G which raised a number of eyebrows. Emerging star Safawi Rasid struck in each half as Tan Cheng Hoe's side followed up their 3-2 victory a few months ago in Jakarta by inflicting another blow on their close neighbours. In one of the region's top derbies, played in front of a fervent 80,000 capacity crowd at the Bukit Jalil Stadium, the visitors were the first to attack and came close to opening the scoring. Having weathered the early storm, however, the hosts took the lead on the half-hour mark courtesy of a Safawi free-kick.\\nThe second half saw both sides produce chances of their own but Malaysia had the final say when Safawi scored from an acute angle to seal the tie. The victory, coupled with the goalless draw between leaders Vietnam and Thailand in the other match, saw the Malayan Tigers move into second place, with a key match-up against United Arab Emirates looming in March.The other attractions\\nMidfielder Ward Salama scored the only goal as Group A leaders Syria stretched their outstanding run of consecutive victories to five with a 1-0 win against the Philippines in Dubai. The win saw Fajr Ibrahim's side open up an eight-point gap at the top, edging closer to an early spot in the next round. In the group's other match, efforts from Ali Samooh and Ali Ashfaq plus an own goal by Travis Nicklaw helped Maldives to a 3-1 victory against Guam at home, a result which moved them within a point of China PR and Philippines.\\nIn Group B, second-placed Kuwait and Jordan both won against their respective rivals to close the gap on leaders Australia. The Kuwaitis defeated hosts Nepal by 1-0 with captain Bader Al Motawaa striking the winner while the Jordanians fired five unanswered goals past visiting Chinese Taipei.\\nGroup C front-runners Iraq kept their two-point cushion intact despite being held to a goalless draw by second-placed Bahrain in Amman. Meanwhile, James Ha opened the scoring midway through the first half, before Roberto Junior struck the match-winner seven minutes from time as Hong Kong defeated ten-man Cambodia 2-0 at home to register their first win in the pool. The result saw Hong Kong trail IR Iran by just a point, making their meeting in March a mouthwatering prospect.\\nIn Group D, a 2-0 win against Palestine at home saw Uzbekistan return to pole position in the pool. In-form striker Eldor Shomurodov struck in each half as the Central Asians bounced back to winning form and leapfrogged Saudi Arabia to the top of the table. The group's other match saw Singapore edge Yemen 2-1 in Bahrain to move to third place.\\nThere were no changes in the top two of Group E, with leaders Qatar and second-placed Oman both prevailing. The Qataris did need a second-half penalty by Akram Afif to secure a solitary-goal victory against Afghanistan, who missed a spot-kick earlier in the first half. The Omanis, for their part, had Mohsin Al Ghassani to thank for scoring the only goal as they sealed a 1-0 win against India at home.\\nIn Group F, Tamirlan Kozubaev struck late to cancel out Jahongir Ergashev's early goal as hosts Kyrgyz Republic came from behind to draw 1-1 with Tajikistan. The result left the two teams still level on points, trailing leaders Japan by five points. In the other match, Myanmar continued their resurgence under new boss Antoine Hey, defeating Mongolia 1-0 at home to register their second consecutive win. Bo Bo Hlaing's first-half strike proved the difference as Myanmar avenged their first-leg loss with a hard-fought victory.\\nIn Group H, the matchday ended with Turkmenistan leapfrogging Korea Republic to the top of the standings. The Central Asians followed up their 3-1 victory against Korea DPR last time out by securing a 2-0 triumph against Sri Lanka courtesy of goals from Abdy Basimov and Altymyrat Annadurdyyew. The result, allied with Lebanon's goalless draw against Korea DPR, saw Ante Mise's side move a point clear at the top.Did you know?\\nThe compelling and difficult nature of this Asian qualifying campaign sees Asia's top-ranked sides - IR Iran and Korea Republic - sitting only third and second in their respective groups with the competition just past the halfway mark.\"},\n",

Notably, IR Iran and United Arab Emirates lost again to see their campaign in real danger while Korea Republic, Korea DPR and Thailand’s hopeful campaigns were dealt with a blow after dropping points.\\nMeanwhile, both Iraq and Saudi Arabia needed last-ditch efforts to win against IR Iran and Uzbekistan respectively but Japan, Syria and Australia maintained their unblemished records with a fourth-straight win to move closer to progression. Join FIFA.com as we take a closer look at the action across Asia.Matchday 5 results\\n14 November\\nGroup A: Maldives 1-2 Philippines, Syria 2-1 China PR\\nGroup B: Kuwait 9-0 Chinese Taipei, Jordan 0-1 Australia\\nGroup C: Hong Kong 0-0 Bahrain, Iraq 2-1 IR Iran\\nGroup D: Yemen 1-0 Palestine, Uzbekistan 2-3 Saudi Arabia\\nGroup E: Afghanistan 1-1 India, Oman 4-1 Bangladesh\\nGroup F: Myanmar 4-3 Tajikistan, Kyrgyz Republic 0-2 Japan\\nGroup G: Malaysia 2-1 Thailand, Vietnam 1-0 United Arab Emirates\\nGroup H: Turkmenistan 3-1 Korea DPR, Lebanon 0-0 Korea Republic\\nThe match\\nUzbekistan 2-3 Saudi Arabia\\nGoals: Eldor Shomurodov 16\\', Otabek Shukurov (pen) 56\\'; Salman Al Faraj (pen) 23\\', 85\\', Salem Al Dawsari 90\\'\\nIn Group D, captain Salman Al Faraj struck a brace as Saudi Arabia defeated hosts Uzbekistan 3-2 in dramatic fashion and leapfrogged their opponents to the top of the section. Indeed, Herve Renard\\'s visitors had to twice come from behind to draw themselves on level terms before sealing the three points through a dramatic last-minute effort.\\nIn what was the two sides\\' fifth World Cup qualifying meeting, Odil Ahmedov\\'s home side started brightly with Eldor Shomurodov opening the scoring with his fourth goal of this campaign. Their lead, however, proved short-lived as Al Faraj drew level minutes later through a spot-kick. Otabek Shukurov would restore the hosts\\' lead with a penalty after the restart, but Al Faraj struck the leveller five minutes from time before Salem Al Dawsari sealed the victory.\\nIn the other match, Omar Al Dahi scored the only goal as Yemen downed Palestine by a solitary goal to move into third place, trailing Uzbekistan by just a point.The other attractions\\nGroup A leaders Syria opened up a five-point cushion at the top of the section after defeating Marcello Lippi\\'s China PR 2-1 in Dubai. Osama Omari put the Syrians ahead but Wu Lei drew the Chinese level as the two sides finished the first half locked at 1-1. The balance was, however, tipped in Syria\\'s favour with defender Zhang Linpeng\\'s second-half own-goal gifting them a fortunate three points.\\nFollowing the match, Lippi announced his resignation as China manager: \"We won against minnows like Maldives and Guam but we drew against Philippines. And today Syria played better than us. I take the responsibility. I declare that I resign from the head coach\\'s post.\" \\nIn the group\\'s other match, the Philippines overcame hosts Maldives by the identical scoreline to move level with China on points.In Group B, Adam Taggart\\'s first-half goal proved the difference as Australia sank hosts Jordan 1-0. The victory saw Graham Arnold\\'s Socceroos cement their place at the top, now five points clear of the Jordanians. In the other match, Kuwait produced the matchday\\'s biggest win by thumping Chinese Taipei 9-0 at home to move level with Jordan on points and ahead of them on goal difference.\\nIn Group C, Asia\\'s top-ranked side IR Iran lost again, this time falling 2-1 to rivals Iraq in Amman. Mohanad Ali gave the Iraqis an early lead but the Iranians drew level midway through the first half through Ahmed Nourollahi. Srecko Katanec’s side had to leave it late when Alaa Abbas sealed the hard-fought win with an injury-time strike. The result, coupled with Bahrain\\'s goalless draw in Hong Kong, saw Iraq create a two-point gap on the Bahrainis while IR Iran, drifted four points from the summit with the their campaign in real jeopardy.\\nIn Group E, a 4-1 win over Bangladesh saw hosts Oman move within a point of leaders Qatar who were not in action. In the other match, Seimeinlen Doungel cancelled out Zelfy Nazary\\'s first-half goal with a last-minute strike as India shared the spoils with Afghanistan in a 1-1 stalemate, a result which saw the two sides\\' hopes further fade away.In Group F, a 2-0 win in Kyrgyz Republic saw Japan extend their lead at the top to six points and move to within touching distance of sealing the section\\'s sole automatic qualifying spot. Takumi Minamino and Genki Haraguchi struck in each half as Hajime Moriyasu\\'s Samurai Blue maintained their perfect record this campaign. Bottom side Myanmar, meanwhile, registered their first points by edging Tajikistan 4-3 at home.\\nIn Group G, Vietnam moved into the section\\'s summit following a shock 1-0 victory over the United Arab Emirates at home. Nguyen Tien Linh scored the only goal as the hosts maintained their undefeated record in this campaign. In the other match, Brendan Gan cancelled out Chanathip Songkrasin\\'s early goal before Mohamadou Sumareh struck the match-winner as Malaysia edged Thailand 2-1 to register a crucial win.\\nIn Group H, both Korea Republic and Korea DPR disappointed by dropping points. The former were held to a goalless draw by hosts Lebanon, while the latter floundered 3-1 in Turkmenistan. Despite the draw, Paulo Bento\\'s visitors remain at the top of the section one point clear of Lebanon and Korea DPR. Turkmenistan, with two victories, are a point further down. With the top four teams separated by just two points, the race for the group\\'s sole qualifying berth remains wide open.\\nDid you know?\\nWhile Australia’s 1-0 win against Jordan was their first away victory in Amman, Myanmar also made a piece of their own history by grabbing their first-ever triumph against Tajikistan.'},\n",

With only the group winners advancing to the next stage, it is a match which neither side can afford to lose.\\nIn a sense, Paulo Bento's visitors boast a slight mental edge, having remained undefeated in the pair’s past six World Cup qualifying meetings with three wins and three draws. Yun Jongsu's hosts can, however, look to their trademark resilient play which has seen them frustrate opponents time and again.\\nEven the match itself is special - it marks the first time that Korea DPR have hosted Korea Republic on home soil in nearly three decades. Ten years back, the Chollima twice held their southern neighbours in neutral Shanghai in their 'home games' en route to successful qualification for South Africa 2010. Sri Lanka host Lebanon in the other group match.The other attractions\\nIn Group A, Marcello Lippi's China travel to the Philippines seeking their third straight win. Team Dragon will look to the goalscoring form of Espanyol forward Wu Lei who scored a brace in their 3-0 drubbing of the Azkals in January's 2019 AFC Asian Cup. In the other match, Syria entertain Guam knowing that there is no room for slip-ups if they are to keep pressure on the Chinese before the two sides’ crunch tie in Dubai next month.\\nGroup B front-runners Australia travel to Chinese Taipei aiming to strengthen their grip on the section with a third consecutive victory. Furthermore, this match provides another opportunity for coach Graham Arnold to test new young players and formations. Second-place Jordan, meanwhile, entertain Nepal in the section's other game seeking to bounce back, having being held to a disappointing goalless draw by Kuwait.\\nIn Group C, Marc Wilmots' free-scoring IR Iran will likely have their first real test against hosts Bahrain who famously inflicted a 3-1 defeat on Team Melli on the road to Korea/Japan 2002. Any slip-ups by IR Iran will benefit Iraq, who can move to the top of the table with a win in Cambodia.\\nGroup D's Palestine will be hoping to reproduce the form which saw them stun Uzbekistan 2-0 in the opener when they entertain Saudi Arabia. In fact, the hosts did catch the Green Falcons by surprise by holding them to a goalless draw at home four years ago during Russia 2018 qualifying. In the other match, Uzbekistan face a must-win against hosts Singapore if they are to keep their campaign on track.\\nGroup E leaders Qatar welcome Oman seeking to prolong their undefeated head-to-head record, having managed two wins and two draws in the past four World Cup qualifying meetings. In the other match, India host pointless Bangladesh in Kolkata’s mighty Salt Lake stadium with each side desperately seeking to rekindle hopes with a first win.\\nIn Group F, joint leaders Tajikistan and Japan do battle with both seeking to move clear with victory. The visiting Samurai Blue smashed 12 unanswered goals past Tajikistan over two legs on the road to Brazil 2014. Mongolia, meanwhile, will look to their ever-growing home support in this campaign as they aim to spring another surprise against visiting Kyrgyz Republic.\\nGroup G pace-setters United Arab Emirates know they will face a tough test in Thailand after the pair played out a tense 1-1 draw in their last meeting during the Asian Cup. In the other match, pointless Indonesia entertain Vietnam desperately needing a win to keep their hopes alive.\\nDid you know?\\nIndia’s meeting with neighbours Bangladesh is the pair’s third FIFA World Cup qualifier and 29th match in all competitions since 1978. The Indians have emerged the dominant side so far with 15 wins and just two defeats.\"},\n",

Playing the home game in neutral Dubai, the Syrians went into the match as the clear favourites considering that they are 68 places above the visitors in the FIFA/Coca-Cola Men’s World Ranking. The opponents had, however, proved capable of upsets in the qualifying campaign in the past, notably holding Korea Republic to a goalless draw on the road to Germany 2006.\\nSyria dominated the proceedings with captain Omar Al Soma striking in each half to give them a 2-0 lead inside 60 minutes. With the hosts looking on course to victory, however, they were reduced to ten men with defender Ahmed Al Salih seeing a red card. Capitalising on the numerical advantage, the Maldives quickly pulled one back through Ali Ashfaq. However, an equaliser didn't come, with the Syrians striving to keep the rivals at bay and run their one-goal lead to victory.\\nIn the group’s other game, in-form forward Yang Xu scored four times as Marcello Lippi's China cruised past Guam 7-0 at home. The results now see Syria and China level on points with the Chinese on top courtesy of their superior goal difference.\\nThe other attractions\\nIn Group B, hosts Australia put five unanswered goals past Nepal at home for their second successive win. Striker Jamie Maclaren completed a hat-trick and young defender Harry Souttar struck in his international debut as Graham Arnold's Socceroos stayed perfect in this campaign. The result, coupled with Jordan’s goalless draw with Kuwait in the other match, saw Australia move clear with a two-point cushion at the top.\\nIR Iran moved clear at the top of Group C after thumping Cambodia 14-0 at home. Indeed, Marc Wilmots' side showed the visitors no mercy. Star striker Karim Ansarifard scored four times and Sardar Azmoun completed a hat-trick as they produced the matchday's biggest win. In the other match, Iraq registered their first win by defeating visiting Hong Kong 2-0 to move to second place level with Bahrain on points.\\nIn Group D, both Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan bounced back to win at home respectively as they put their campaigns back on track. The former beat Singapore 3-0 to move to the top of the section and the latter swept past Yemen 5-0 to register their first win under new boss Vadim Abramov.\\nGroup E front-runners Qatar cemented their place at the top by overcoming hosts Bangladesh 2-0. Forwards Yusuf Abdurisag and Karim Boudiaf scored in each half as the visitors got past the resilient home side. Oman, meanwhile, defeated Afghanistan 3-0 at home to maintain pressure on the Qataris, trailing by merely a point.\\nGroup F favourites Japan followed up their 2-0 opening win over Myanmar with a 6-0 resounding victory against Mongolia at home. Goals from six different players, including Daichi Kamada, gave Hajime Moriyasu's side a second consecutive win. The result moved the Samurai Blue to the top of the table level with Tajikistan on points. In the section’s other match, Edgar Bernhardt scored a hat-trick as Kyrgyz Republic hammered Myanmar 7-0 at home for their first win in this campaign, and significantly, their biggest ever victory in international competition.\\nIn Group G, United Arab Emirates leapfrogged Thailand to the top of the table by defeating Indonesia 5-0 at home, with ace striker Ali Mabkhout completing a hat-trick. In the other match, Nguyen Quang Hai struck the only goal as Vietnam defeated Malaysia 1-0 at home for their first win in this campaign.\\nIn Group H, towering forward Kim Shinwook struck four times and captain Son Heungmin completed a brace as Korea Republic ran out 8-0 victors against Sri Lanka. The win moved the Taeguk Warriors level with Korea DPR on points at the top, making the two sides’ crunch tie in five days a mouthwatering one. The group’s other match saw Lebanon clinch their first win, defeating Turkmenistan 2-1.\\nDid you know?\\nWhile IR Iran's 14-0 victory stood out as the biggest of the matchday, the double-digit scoreline paled in comparison to their 19-0 victory against Guam in a qualifier for Korea/Japan 2002, which remains as Team Melli's all-time biggest win.\"},\n",

And their head-to-head record adds further weight to Qatar’s favourtism with the 2022 FIFA World Cup™ hosts boasting two wins and a draw in their past three meetings, all in AFC Asian Cup qualifying. Yet Felix Sanchez's charges received a wake-up call in their last outing when they could only manage a goalless draw against India at home, with their campaign doubling as Asian Cup qualifying.\\nDespite losing to Afghanistan by a solitary-goal in the opener, Jamie Day's Bangladesh are keen to prove themselves in front of their home supporters. Of course, few question Qatar's status as the undisputed favourites after their spectacular form that secured a maiden Asian Cup in January.\\nThe section's other match pits Oman against Afghanistan, both currently locked in second on three points and aiming to move clear with victory.The other attractions\\nIn Group A, Marcello Lippi's China PR welcome Guam seeking a second win but they will be wary of Karl Dodd's visitors, who pulled off stunning victories against the likes of India and Turkmenistan on the road to Russia 2018. In the group's other match, Syria entertain Maldives in Dubai hoping to continue their winning form.\\nGroup B's Australia welcome Nepal confident of building on their proud home record - the Socceroos' only home defeat since 1981 was a 1-0 reversal against China in 2008 when their qualifying mission had already been completed. Jordan, meanwhile, entertain Kuwait hoping that they can manage a better result than the 1-1 draw in the two sides' WAFF Championship meeting a couple of months ago.\\nIn Group C, a second win is firmly in IR Iran's grasp when they host Cambodia, despite missing star attacker Alireza Jahanbakhsh. Coach Marc Wilmots does not lack for firepower with ace-strikers Sardar Azmoun and Mehdi Taremi at his disposal. Iraq welcome Hong Kong in the group's other match with the hosts determined to bounce back with a victory having drawn 1-1 against Bahrain in the opener.\\nIn Group D, both Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan enter the matchday hoping to put their campaign back on track with victories against Singapore and Yemen respectively. The West Asians can take heart from their undefeated record while the Central Asians, under returning boss Vadim Abramov, will be confident of prolonging their superior record having won all four past World Cup qualifying meetings against the Yemenis.\\nIn Group F, coach Hajime Moriyasu has named a full-strength Japan squad largely consisting of their European-based stars as they aim to secure a second successive win against Mongolia at home. The other match sees hosts Kyrgyz Republic and Myanmar seeking to grab their first points.\\nGroup G bottom side Indonesia travels to United Arab Emirates desperately seeking to stay in touch with the rest of the group after suffering back-to-back losses at home. However, Bert van Marwijk's side boast strong home form, including three wins and a draw in local conditions during their Russia 2018 campaign. A pair of old foes re-unite in the other match with hosts Vietnam and Malaysia hoping to get back on track with victory.\\nElsewhere, Group H favourites Korea Republic host Sri Lanka with their sights fixed firmly on three points while pointless Lebanon entertain Turkmenistan keen to rekindle their hopes with a win at home.\\nDid you know?\\nIraq fans will end their long wait for a game on home soil when they will finally host a World Cup qualifier as they welcome Hong Kong to the Basra International Stadium.

In the section's other match, Goran Milojevic's Philippines put their opening 5-2 loss to Syria behind them by defeating hosts Guam 4-1.

Davron Ergashev headed home the match-winner nine minutes from time as the Central Asians consolidate their place at the top. The section's other match saw Japan get their campaign off to a perfect start by winning 2-0 in Myanmar.

       "   'content': \"Iran face stern tests in Iraq and Bahrain\\nSouth-east quartet grouped together\\nAustralia resume rivalry with Jordan\\nAsia's top forty teams have learned the hurdles they must overcome on the road to the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ after the draw for the second qualifying round took place in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on Wednesday.\\nDivided into eight groups of five, these sides will battle it out against each other across ten months from 5 September 2019 to 9 June 2020, with the eight section winners and four best runners-up advancing. Should Qatar win their group, the other seven group winners and five best runners-up who progress to the next stage.\\nConducted by FIFA Director of Competitions Christian Unger and Australian FIFA Legend Tim Cahill, the draw did provide some enticing pairings which see familiar foes reunite. Meanwhile, there are emerging sides who enter this campaign seeking to mount serious challenges to the traditional powerhouses. Join FIFA.com as we take a closer look at the groups.Groups overview\\nGroup A: China PR, Syria, Philippines, Maldives, Guam\\nGroup B: Australia, Jordan, Chinese Taipei, Kuwait, Nepal\\nGroup C: Iran, Iraq, Bahrain, Hong Kong, Cambodia\\nGroup D: Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, Palestine, Yemen, Singapore\\nGroup E: Qatar, Oman, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh\\nGroup F: Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Myanmar, Mongolia\\nGroup G: United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia\\nGroup H: Korea Republic, Lebanon, Korea DPR, Turkmenistan, Sri Lanka\\nHeadline-grabbers\\nGroup G is definitely an interesting one to watch with four South-east Asia teams crossing paths in what looks a regional competition. Joining the quartet is the group's top seed, United Arab Emirates, who aim to seal their World Cup return. While the Italy 1990 participants are the highly-favoured side, they cannot underestimate their competition. Both Thailand and Vietnam pose a threat considering their impressive displays in this year's AFC Asian Cup, while Indonesia and Malaysia can spring a surprise or two.\\nThere will likely be a three-way battle in Group C, with Asia's top-ranked side Iran pitted against a pair of nemeses in Iraq and Bahrain. Team Melli may enter the campaign as the team to beat, but both rivals have historically proved capable of causing them headaches. Iraq scored a 2-1 victory against Iran on the road to USA 1994, while Bahrain can take heart from their famous 3-1 stunner in 2002 World Cup qualifying.The other attractions\\nAsia's most successful side on the qualifying scene, Group H top seed Korea Republic, enter the competition with their sights fixed firmly on their tenth World Cup appearance. While a place in the next round appears within their grasp, Paulo Bento's Taegeuk Warriors will need to be wary of the resilient Korea DPR and Lebanon.\\nGroup B will see Australia and Jordan resume their fast-developing rivalry, having played against each other in four World Cup qualifying matches for the past two World Cups. Each side has two victories from those encounters, but Jordan's recent 1-0 Asian Cup win provides them with a boost.\\nChina PR and Syria are likely to dominate the proceedings in Group A, which also features the Philippines, Maldives and Guam. Marcello Lippi's new-look Team Dragon will enter the group determined to seal the top spot.\\nIn Group D, Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan cross swords in what will be their fifth World Cup qualifying encounter. While the two sides are favourites to finish at the top, Palestine have proved hard to crack, while both Yemen and Singapore can impress when they are on top of their game.\\nWith reigning Asian champions and the 2022 World Cup hosts Qatar the undisputed favourites to win Group E, Oman and India will likely be left vying for the second spot and a potential qualifying position.\\nIt looks a kind draw for Japan alongside the likes of Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Myanmar and debutants Mongolia. The only question mark may be which side can take the second qualifying spot.\\nDid you know?\\nTwo years, five months and 24 days is the length of time required to decide Asia's qualified teams for Qatar 2022, with the massive campaign running from 6 June 2019 till 16 November 2021.\"},\n",

In order to do so, FIFA has worked with reputable entities, such as United Nations agencies, with which we have formed a strong working relationship on human rights issues in recent years.\\n\"The former president of the Afghanistan Football Federation was eventually banned for life and fined CHF 1 million by the independent Ethics Committee, which is the strongest sanction that can be imposed under the FIFA Code of Ethics. Furthermore, FIFA is carefully looking into allegations levelled against additional persons, and will not hesitate to take appropriate measures and impose sanctions if justified, just as it has done in the case of the president of the association.\\n\"FIFA has also taken a leading role in supporting those players who were forced to leave Afghanistan to gain asylum in safe environments and out of immediate danger. We continue to stay in close contact with them and support them in rebuilding their lives and recovering from the abhorrent ordeal they have suffered. The coach of the national team, Kelly Lindsey, is well aware of these efforts and the support that FIFA has provided, and we are therefore surprised and disappointed by her criticism, which we consider to be both ill-informed and unjustified.\\n\"We would like to reiterate that FIFA has a zero-tolerance policy on human-rights violations and unequivocally condemns all forms of gender-based violence.”'},\n",

There has to be a winner and a loser, right?\\nFor Mika Sayfurahman (wearing No13 pictured above), who turns 15 today, she has a perspective that even some adults lack. Don’t get it wrong, she wants to win every game she plays, but playing for the Afghanistan women’s national team has provided a wider view on the world and given her a great purpose.\\n“My goal is to inspire young girls to start playing soccer,” Sayfurahman told FIFA.com. “That’s my main goal.”\\nMika is one of several examples of players that represent a new dawn and a hope for Afghan women wanting to make it as professional footballers.\\nShe picked up the game as a four-year-old, passing the ball around with her father at her brothers’ soccer practices in California, where she grew up most of her life.\\nIt was there in California where she was discovered by Afghanistan women’s national team assistant coach Haley Carter, at a tournament hosted by the close-knit Afghan community in the Bay Area. Just a few months later, she was on a plane to India on her way to represent Afghanistan at the South Asian Football Federation Championship.\\n“Mika stood out right away,” Carter told FIFA.com. “She’s a little bitty thing, but she’s fierce. She’s got a great attitude, she works really hard, she’s really coachable, she’s hilarious and has a great sense of humour. She’s a really good source of energy to have around.\\n“She’s actually one of the more mature players from a soccer IQ and professionalism stand-point. She’s serious about the game and passionate about her development.”\\nSayfurahman embodies everything Afghanistan head coach Kelly Lindsey and her staff wants: skill, high technical ability, fitness, ability to play a physical game, ability to read the game, professionalism and passion for the game. “She’s young, but she set’s the example,” Carter said.Sayfurahman and the Afghanistan women’s national team, originally formed in 2007, recently played Jordan, hosts of the upcoming 2018 AFC Women’s Asian Cup and a top-50 side, in a pair of friendlies in which they were on the end of two lopsided scorelines (5-0 and 6-0).\\nBut don’t let the results take away from the bigger picture. In football, there’s always a story behind the headline, and in this case, Afghanistan learned a great deal from the experience.\\n“We didn’t just sit back and play defence,” Carter said. “We told the girls, ‘Go out and play.' You can sit and park the bus, but this isn’t a major tournament and it doesn’t do you any good to do that. That’s not how you’re going to get better.\\n“To go and compete against a team that’s ranked 50th, who I am confident will qualify for the World Cup, and come out with that scoreline is massive. It’s huge.”\\nFor Carter, there are two tangible objectives for the future: moving up the FIFA/Coca-Cola Women’s World Ranking and participating in the preliminary round for the next AFC Women’s Asian Cup cycle.\\n“We need to see a quantifiable jump in the FIFA Ranking in that it will help us drive fundraising efforts,” Carter said. “When we can quantify the progress that’s being made, that’s going to go a really long way.”\\nWhat gives Carter and Sayfurahman hope about the team in the next few years?\\n“The youth of this team and the interest and their passion to drive this programme forward, be a part of it and make the investment, is huge,” Carter said. “Secondly, the unity we have. We tell them, ‘You’re all Afghan. We’re all one team. We’re all fighting for the same things.’ We’re getting to a place now that players are reaching out to us because they want to participate.”\\nThe players on the team take accountability and responsibility seriously and have created a leadership council and give the staff feedback. Momentum is building in many ways.\\n“We all treat each other like sisters,” Sayfurahman said. “We’re all really close to each other. I really love all of them. I think the future’s bright. We have a lot of talent.”\"},\n",

Mohammad Hossein Mirshamsi’s side started their campaign with a 14-0 thumping of tournament hosts Malaysia before earning results against Afghanistan (6-1), China PR (10-0) and Bahrain (5-2).

Thailand, 0 pts\\n*The last-minute withdrawal of Uzbekistan from Malaysia 2017 put the onus on the remaining three teams in Group B to try and win both of their group matches in order to advance to the last four. After both sides claimed victories over Thailand, Oman and Lebanon squared off in the group decider. In a dramatic contest, the Lebanese ended Oman’s reign as Asian champions with a 4-3 victory.

The Emiratis opened their account with a 6-0 win over Iraq before easing past Qatar 8-1. The Japanese were even more prolific in front of goal, thrashing the Qataris 14-0 and the Iraqis 11-2. That set up a group decider between UAE and Japan, and it was the Middle Eastern nation that triumphed 5-4 to win Group C and advance to the semi-finals. Despite the defeat, Japan also advanced to the last four as the best second-best finisher in the group stage.      \\nKnockout rounds\\nThe first two qualifying places for Bahamas 2017 were up for grabs in the semi-finals on 10 March, and the day’s action started with a penalty shoot-out victory for UAE over Lebanon following a 4-4 extra-time draw.

Mokhtari, Hassan Abdollahi and Mohammad Ahmadzadeh each scored twice for the Iranians, as they advanced to Saturday’s final and claimed their country’s seventh berth at a Beach Soccer World Cup.\\nThe final day of action on 11 March saw the two losing semi-finalists in Lebanon and Japan contest the final qualifying berth for the Bahamas in the match for third place.

       "   'content': 'There was nothing unusual about the way Khalida Popal started out playing football – it all began with a ball. Yet what is remarkable is that she did so in her homeland Afghanistan, a country where it used to be unthinkable for women to participate in sports, especially those that take place in public.\\n\"I remember the day my mother brought me football boots,\" she told FIFA.com in an exclusive interview. \"We had a very old football at our school, but didn\\'t have any other activities after school. So we would kick the ball around and have fun, but one day we had trouble with some men, who said, \\'Football isn\\'t for women. It’s an insult for the game if women play.\\' That made us stand up for our right to play, stand up for women’s rights and for gender equality.\"\\nSuch comments highlight that the game was far more than just a pastime for Popal; it became a way for her to fight for women\\'s rights in her homeland and to bring about a change in society. It was certainly no easy task for the 28-year-old, who made history in 2007 by becoming the first captain of the Afghanistan women\\'s national team. She encountered extreme opposition, with her brother and coach both beaten in order to force her to quit. Fearing for her life, she eventually fled Afghanistan alone in April 2011. She escaped to India and applied for asylum to Denmark, where she still lives.* *\"When I became the head of the women’s football committee my voice was very strong,\" Popal said, outlining why she left Afghanistan. \"I was really enjoying the time and the victory of football becoming more widely known in Afghanistan. We talked and played openly there. That was when I thought, \\'We\\'re winning\\'. But suddenly everything changed when my voice grew and the message got very strong.\\n\"I didn\\'t know that my voice would pose a threat to my life as a leader who wanted to empower women in the country through sports, and to encourage them to join the movement. I faced death threats and had to choose to leave my country. It was a really difficult decision. But I never give up on my dreams, my objective and my fight for women because it\\'s very important. That’s why I\\'m still involved in women’s football.\"* *\\n*Paving the way *Not only has the former defender blazed a trail for the next generation to follow, she has also helped increase the importance of the women\\'s game. \"When I started playing in 2004 there were only a few girls, maybe eight to ten, playing football for the first time in the history of the country,\" Popal said. \"Now there are more than two or three thousand women playing in Afghanistan - not only in the capital city but in the surrounding area too.\" She also revealed that several events are planned in Afghanistan in honour of International Women\\'s Day, although she will be unable to attend them personally.\\n\"I love my country and I love working in my country. But as long as the situation doesn\\'t change, I\\'ll keep working for women’s football in Afghanistan. I\\'m the programme director of the national team. I coordinate the programmes and organise different events in the country from abroad. That keeps me alive and happy. Even if I\\'m far away from my country, I\\'m still connected to it.\"\\nPopal has already spoken at the United Nations and at diverse human rights conferences across the globe about her fight for women\\'s rights. She was also among the guest speakers at the FIFA Conference for Equality and Inclusion, which took place at the Home of FIFA on Monday.\\n\"Being at this event at this conference is a great opportunity for me,\" said the Kabul native. \"It\\'s a great platform to send out the message to the authorities, to the people who are the decision makers, to the people who make decisions about improving women\\'s football, the people who empower women in order to increase gender equality. I\\'m very happy and it was a great opportunity that I could talk directly to the FIFA President and that he was there to hear.\"\\nPerhaps her commitment to the cause will soon be rewarded, and her deepest ambition could become a reality. \"It\\'s my dream,\" she explained, \"to see the Afghanistan women’s national team play at a World Cup.\"'},\n",

Images of him wearing a plastic bag of Argentinian national colours with Messi written on the back had gone viral on social media earlier this year. Subsequently, the ‘Albiceleste’ (white and sky blue) superstar had sent young Murtaza a signed jersey and football, and promised to meet him in person when the chance arose. \\nThe Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) was inspired by the story of the small boy and his dream, and decided to try and find him to give him the chance of meeting his hero.\\nOn 13 December, that day arrived. Murtaza finally got the chance to hold his hero’s hand and got a giant hug from Messi on the morning of the ‘Match of Champions’ game between Barcelona and Al Ahli on Tuesday. As the Barcelona players walked past him on the way to a meeting room at the team hotel, Murtaza spotted Messi and reached out a hand, which the Argentina superstar held with a big smile. \\nA few moments later, Murtaza received a large embrace from his hero, who held him in his arms as the Barcelona team gathered behind him.Speaking with sc.qa, Murtaza said after his meeting with Messi: “I’m very happy to have met my hero. It is a dream for me. I can’t wait to see Messi at the game, it will be the first time for me in the stadium.”\\nOn Tuesday evening, Murtaza was selected as one of the player escorts to walk out onto the pitch with his idol, providing another memory of a lifetime for him on his trip to Doha. \\nAn SC spokesperson said: “It was inspirational to meet Murtaza, and see him fulfil his dream. We were all kids once and had dreams, and in Qatar many of us still have them. \\n“Murtaza’s dream was to meet his hero. We are in a fortunate position here that we were able to bring them together. It’s about a kid and his dream. That’s it. That pretty much sums up the power of football.\\n\"We were struck by his story from the beginning, and are delighted that we made the meeting happen. The story is symbolic of our belief that football can change lives for the better, and inspire youngsters from across our region and beyond.\"'},\n",

       "   'content': 'For several nations, Asia’s second stage of qualifying for the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ will be remembered as a watershed campaign. Hitherto unscaled heights were conquered by a number of countries whose international achievement had previously been modest.\\nThailand’s War Elephants reflected the nation’s recent success in the AFC Champions League by reaching the final stage in style after finishing top of their group. Syria, meanwhile, defied all expectations given the nation’s high-profile domestic troubles, to also advance with six wins from eight outings.\\nAt the other end of the scale, *FIFA.com *takes a look at some of the nations whose campaign may be over but, thanks to some history-making achievements, is far from forgotten.\\nAfghanistan\\nAfghanistan are on a clear upward trajectory, despite spending the best part of two decades in the international wilderness due to the political turmoil in their homeland. Since returning to the international sphere in 2002 their progress has been impressive, but never more so than in recent times. Their three previous FIFA World Cups campaigns have failed to yield a single win, yet the current crop achieved three victories this time around, capped by a notable triumph this week over four-time southeast Asia champions Singapore. This, despite being forced to play their home matches in Iran, although thousands of Afghani diaspora were on hand this week to witness the team’s best World Cup win to date. The 2013 South Asian champions - and 2015 runners-up - now have a realistic chance of qualification for a maiden AFC Asian Cup after winning through to the qualifying stage.\\n*Guam *\\nIt is hard to imagine a nation of just 170,000 citizens overcoming one of over one billion, but that is exactly what Guam achieved last year when they defeated India during Russia 2018 qualifying. Yet 15 years earlier, they suffered a then record 19-0 World Cup defeat. The contrast is somewhat of a metaphor for the team’s development, both technically and mentally, during the tenure of English coach Gary White. Under White, the team have embraced their indigenous Chamorro culture. Now known as the Matao, the remote north Pacific nation have reached unimaginable heights in relative terms. That victory over India last June, was preceded a few days earlier with a win over Turkmenistan in the nation’s long-awaited home World Cup qualifier. Incredibly Guam, discounting their two games against Iran, conceded just three goals in six matches, finishing fourth in the group.\\n*Hong Kong *\\nThe history of football in Hong Kong incorporates not just the foundation years of the Asian Football Confederation during the 1950s, but back almost to the turn of the last century. The territory off the coast of China PR was a force in Asian football many decades ago, and now the wheel is starting to turn once again. Hong Kong’s most famous World Cup result remains a barely imaginable 2-1 win over China in 1985, but two draws against the same opponent during the current campaign left the world’s biggest nation sweating for a result on the final matchday. Hong Kong ultimately finished third, just three points off qualification. Under wily Korea Republic coach Kim Pan-Gon, the national team are finding success reflective of the work done at grassroots levels over recent years by the Hong Kong Football Association.\\n*Palestine *\\nFresh from featuring in their maiden Asian Cup at the commencement of 2015, Palestine continued to demonstrate their capabilities throughout Russia 2018 qualifiers. Finishing third in their group, Palestine’s results were extraordinary in the circumstances. They held United Arab Emirates - boasting arguably the continent’s best attack - to a scoreless draw, and proved it was no fluke by reprising that scoreline against reinvigorated west Asian aristocrats Saudi Arabia, with the latter result achieved in neutral Jordan. Three wins from their eight matches is comfortably a new high. Technically gifted and physically powerful, Palestine now have in place the building blocks for further success.\\n*Philippines *\\nLong regarded one of southeast Asia’s weaker football nations, Philippines have well and truly shrugged off that tag in recent years. Firstly under German mentor Michael Weiss, and more recently under former USA captain Thomas Dooley, the Azkals are now capable of providing stiff opposition to any team on the continent. That new found resolve was in evidence on Tuesday as the Philippines completed an eleventh-hour 3-2 comeback win over 2010 World Cup participants Korea DPR, a team normally renowned for their defensive steadfastness. The result was doubly significant given victory for Korea DPR would have been enough for the *Chollima *to stay in the race for Russia 2018, at the expense of neighbours China.\\nHistorically, Philippines have rarely participated in World Cup qualifying, and remarkably they didn’t feature as recently as the campaign for South Africa 2010. But their new-look team, which includes numerous players with overseas experience, won three of their eight matches, dramatically improving on a previous record of one win from 13 previous outings.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"It has taken nine months, and some 150 matches featuring 39 nations, but 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ qualifying in Asia is finally on the cusp of concluding its second stage. The globe’s largest continent will see its Russia 2018 campaign whittled down to 12 teams on Tuesday. From there, four sides will book progression to Russia, while a fifth will enter into an intercontinental play-off against a CONCACAF opponent.\\nFor now, though, all the focus is on Tuesday. Five teams are already through to September’s third stage – Qatar, Korea Republic, Japan, Saudi Arabia and Thailand – leaving seven spots to be filled on what promises to be a compelling denouement to stage two. The top teams in each of the eight groups will progress, alongside the four best second-placed teams. There are also tickets to AFC Asian Cup qualifying up for grabs. FIFA.compreviews all the action.\\nThe match\\n*Australia-Jordan\\n*It is winner-takes-all in Sydney in a near-repeat of a scenario from four years ago. On that occasion Australia overpowered Jordan with a crucial 4-0 win to end the latter’s Brazil 2014 hopes. As was the case during that campaign, Jordan notched a win over the Socceroos in Amman. Now Jordan head Down Under needing to reprise last October’s 2-0 victory if they are to leapfrog their rivals into top spot in Group B and guarantee progress. Former English Premier League manager Harry Redknapp will be making his second appearance in the Jordanian dugout, though his task is a challenging one with the Socceroos protecting a strong home record, and needing just a point. Both Australia and Jordan enter the match in goalscoring form have netted seven and eight goals respectively on Thursday. Fourth-placed Tajikistan will host third-placed Kyrgyzstan with only pride on the line.\\nThe other attractions *A fascinating contest is in prospect in Abu Dhabi where United Arab Emirates need to beat a rejuvenated Saudi Arabia by two goals to finish top of *Group A. UAE’s much vaunted attack was relatively quiet in a 2-0 win over Palestine on Thursday, and a failure to fire here may leave the Asian Cup bronze medal winners facing a contest to be one of the best runner-ups. The other match sees Palestine host Timor-Leste as two teams from opposite corners of the sprawling continent do battle.\\nMuch focus will be on Group C where China PR need a win at home against the already-qualified Qatar, or face the very real prospect of yet another early elimination from World Cup qualifying. It promises to be a nervous night for the Chinese against a side with momentum and form on their side. While the world’s most populous nation have stumbled through qualifying, leaders Qatar have remained perfect. Elsewhere, Ricki Herbert’s Maldives, who will be without the services of goalscoring ace Ali Ashfaq, will seek to end their campaign on a high in Male against modest Bhutan.\\nThree points clear and with a 15-goal advantage, Group D leaders Iran welcome second-placed Oman with what is effectively an unassailable advantage. Oman have second sewn up, but like many other second-placed teams, they are in a desperate scramble to accrue as many points as possible. The other group match will see India complete a disappointing campaign by welcoming Turkmenistan.\\nMeanwhile over in Group E, Syria are in a very similar position to Oman. They visit continental big guns Japan with second assured, but needing points to ensure they become one of the elite quartet to advance. Regardless of the outcome in Saitama, it has been a remarkable campaign for Syria given the troubles in their homeland. Singapore, who are assured of third, will bid farewell to coach Bernd Stange when they meet home side Afghanistan, in a match being hosted in Tehran.\\nA third match being played in Tehran is perhaps the most crucial of all with second in Group Fon the line as Iraq host Vietnam. Runaway leaders Thailand dominated the group, but neighbours Vietnam can unexpectedly join them if they somehow conjure a win over the 2007 Asian champions.\\nGroup G sees Lebanon seeking a big win over the ever-improving Myanmar as they scramble for a possible best runners-up ticket. The Cedars will need to recover their zest after conceding an injury-time defeat against Korea Republic on Thursday, in a result which may ultimately prove costly.\\nFinally to Group H where Uzbekistan and Korea DPR chase automatic progression. The Uzbeks, boasting strong home form, can retain first with a win over the visiting Bahrain. Korea DPR, who sit two points adrift, face a challenging trip to meet Philippines having dropped two points against the *Azkals *earlier in the campaign.\\nThe player\\nUnited Arab Emirates’ powerfully-built attacker Ahmad Khalil has continued his rare form of 2015 into the current year. The 2015 AFC Player of the Year netted in Thursday’s 2-0 win over Palestine for his 11th goal during Russia 2018 qualifying.\\n*Did you know? *Australia have lost just one World Cup qualifier at home since 1981. Their only defeat came during the past 35 years came against China PR in 2008 as coach Pim Verbeek fielded an experimental side ahead of the Beijing Olympics.\\nThe quote\\n“Iran is still at top of the group and we want to advance to the next stage as the first team,”Iran coach Carlos Queirozremains focussed as his side prepare to host Oman.\\nMatchday fixtures\\n29 March\\nGroup A: United Arab Emirates-Saudi Arabia, Palestine-Timor Leste \\nGroup B: Australia-Jordan, Tajikistan-Kyrgyzstan\\nGroup C: China PR-Qatar, Maldives-Bhutan\\nGroup D: Iran-Oman, India-Turkmenistan\\nGroup E: Japan-Syria, Afghanistan-Singapore\\nGroup F: Iraq-Vietnam\\nGroup G: Lebanon-Myanmar\\nGroup H: Philippines-Korea DPR, Uzbekistan-Bahrain\\nRegulations:The second-placed teams in the five-team groups will have their results against the group's bottom side discounted to create an equal standing compared to Group F, which only has four teams.

       "   'content': \"Shinji Okazaki seems to have been walking on air over the last few months. Nimble, agile and a source of perpetual motion across the frontline whomever he represents, the Japan and Leicester City forward has been turning heads as the 2015/16 season approaches its conclusion.\\nHe was at his balletic best when he opened the scoring for Japan against Afghanistan as the  Samurai Blue secured a place in the next round of Asian qualify for 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia, a highlight of a campaign that has potential for plenty. The first of his season’s targets was wrapped up in what ended as a comfortable 5-0 victory for Vahid Halilhodzic’s side, but up until the former Mainz forward struck, the visitors had proved a tough nut to crack.\\nTurns out, all that was need was a little finesse. That is an attribute Okazaki has in spades, which he duly displayed to all watching in Saitama on his 99th Japanese appearance. With his back to goal on the edge of the area, he teased Makoto Hasebe’s pass into his path with a neat 180 degree turn, before bursting past his marker with a Messi-esque change of direction and cool left-footed finish. Seen on a loop, the goal takes on a mesmeric quality.\\n“We had some difficult moments in the first half, so my goal came at an important time,” he modestly explained following the final whistle.\\nThe game also saw Halilhodzic implement a front two. pairing Okazaki with Mu Kanazaki – a system the Leicester striker has shone this season. The system had been untested before the game and the Bosnian coach was delighted with the results. “That was a truly beautiful win,” he reflected after the game.\\n“At the beginning we were passing the ball a bit too quickly, and some of the players were trying to do too much. But overall our team played phenomenally well, with a new system which I had never tried before with them.”\\nFrom club to country\\nAllowing Okazaki to seamlessly bring his fine form from club to country certainly was a shrewd move. The now Japanese veteran – who stands as one of just two men to score at two different FIFA World Cups for the Samurai Blue – has been quietly making the difference behind Leicester's star performers, Riyadh Mahrez, Jamie Vardy and N’Golo Kante. His startling overhead-kick winner against Newcastle United was a brief step into the spotlight amid his more unsung contributions.\\nHaving developed his talents at Shimizu S-Pulse, then making a name for himself as a predator over five years in Germany at Stuttgart and Mainz, he now finds himself sat at the top of the English Premier League – something he readily admits is a new experience.\\n“In the past, I’ve never been part of a championship run like this, so for me this is a great experience,” he said, with the Foxes currently five points clear. “I have team-mates who have produced great results and are very hard-working and supportive, which is a good combination. And it’s great to be part of such a team that is at the top of the league.”\\nHis five goals this term have helped them to claim a crucial 13 points and, as he explained, their progress has been followed keenly in Japan. “People are paying attention and took notice when I signed with Leicester,” Okazaki said. “I think it’s become a big thing back home.”\\nSet to mark his international century against Syria on Tuesday, he’ll no doubt be keen to add to his tally of 48 goals for his country and return to England’s midlands with the wind firmly in his sails.\"},\n",

First, though, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, Australia and Jordan, Iran and Oman, and Japan and Syria must avoid unforeseen slip-ups at the penultimate hurdle. That is when Thailand, the Pot 3 outsiders who are five points clear, require just a draw against Iraq in Iran. Anything less, however, would agonisingly leave their opponents as the favourites for the pool’s automatic ticket.\\nLet FIFA.com take you on an extended tour of Thursday’s 15 fixtures.\\nThe big game\\nIraq-Thailand\\nOthers know them as ‘The War Elephants’. Their fans call them ‘The Barcelona of Asia’. And it is with that tika-taka style that Thailand have defeated the higher-ranked Vietnam home and away, taken six points off Chinese Taipei, and scored two late goals to hold Iraq in Bangkok to leave themselves a point away from the unthinkable in Group F. Getting it against Iraq is, nevertheless, a big ask. The Mexico 1986 participants may be ‘hosting’ the game in bordering Iran, but they boast players of the calibre of Udinese’s Ali Adnan and the evergreen Younis Mahmoud. Iraq are at home to Vietnam on the final day, so Chanathip Songkrasin, Theerathon and Co head to Tehran knowing they will probably need a result. Will they get it? It is anyone’s guess, but it will be fun watching the pass princes try.\\nThe other attractions\\n*Saudi Arabia head second-placed United Arab Emirates by three on points and goal difference in *Group A, and both are expected to beat respective visitors Malaysia and Palestine. The Green Falcons, for whom Saeed Al-Owairan scored arguably one of the greatest goals in World Cup history at the RFK Stadium in Washington, will nevertheless be out to outscore the UAE and effectively clinch top spot before the Persian Gulf rivals clash in Abu Dhabi.\\nIt is a similar scenario in Group B. Australia and Jordan, who are two points off the pace, square off in Sydney on the final day. First, however, they must avoid stumbles at home to Tajikistan and Bangladesh, respectively.\\nChina may be three points behind Hong Kong in Group C, but they have reason for optimism in the race to finish as runners-up. The Korea/Japan 2002 participants have a game in hand, a superior goal difference, and host a Maldives side they overpowered 3-0 away, while their rivals visit free-scoring Qatar in their final outing. The Chinese entertain the Qataris on the concluding matchday.\\nOman may only be three points behind Group D leaders Iran, whom they still have to play, but their vastly inferior goal difference means they really require an unlikely Indian favour in Tehran. The Reds, for their part, entertain Guam in Muscat.\\nJapan and Syria both won 6-0 away to Afghanistan and Cambodia respectively. The emperors from the east and the emerging Eagles from the west will be expected to cruise to victory in the return fixtures – results which should send both through in Group E.\\n“We may be through, but we still want to advance with maximum points and no goals against,” said Uli Stielike ahead of his Korea Republic side’s Group G swansong. That was discomforting to Lebanese ears, with Miodrag Radulovic’s team having ground to make up in the battle for best runners-up slots. Kuwait’s final two games will not unfold due to the FA’s suspension.\\nUzbekistan are one point beneath Group H leaders Korea DPR and boast a superior goal difference heading into their game in hand. A comfortable friendly defeat of Lebanon last month took gave the White Wolves a sixth successive victory, and they will expect to breeze past Philippines, whom they thrashed 5-1 in the sides’ last encounter, and leave their destiny in their own hands. Bahrain and Yemen meet in the other contest.\\n*Player to watch\\n*In their quest for goals, the Saudis will be delighted to have *Mohammad Al-Sahlawi *leading their line. The 29-year-old has thrived over the last two years, and has hit 22 goals in as many internationals.\\n*Did you know?\\n*Andrei Piatnitski, having already represented Uzbekistan, played against eventual champions Brazil at USA 1994. Server Djeparov, the White Wolves’ long-time poster boy, can at least boast that his son is named after a man who scored in three World Cups: Raul. Ironically, the Spanish icon also named his first son after a footballer: Jorge Valdano, whose goal helped Argentina win the Mexico 1986 Final.\\n*The quote\\n*Kiatisuk Senamuang, Thailand coach: “Nobody gave us a chance at the start. Now we’re on the verge of making it. We’re not afraid of the Iraqis. They need six points while we only need a draw. We’ll be going for the win though – that and playing attractive football are things we believe in.”\\nPenultimate matchday fixtures\\n*24 March\\n*Group A: Saudi Arabia-Malaysia, United Arab Emirates-Palestine\\nGroup B: Australia-Tajikistan, Jordan-Bangladesh\\nGroup C: China PR-Maldives, Qatar-Hong Kong\\nGroup D: Iran-India, Oman-Guam\\nGroup E: Japan-Afghanistan, Syria-Cambodia\\nGroup F: Vietnam-Chinese Taipei, Iraq-Thailand\\nGroup G: Korea Republic-Lebanon\\nGroup H: Uzbekistan-Philippines, Bahrain-Yemen\\nRegulations: The second-placed teams in the five-team groups will have their results against the group's bottom side discounted to create an equal standing compared to Group F, which only has four teams.

The West Ham United forward did not celebrate the one that came his way tonight, however. And nor did Austria’s late winner seem to bring him much pleasure. The reason for that was simple: his father is Serbian, and Arnautovic knew full well that he would be suffering as a result of his efforts and Austria’s hard-fought win'},\n",

       "   'content': '*Two matchdays to go in European qualifying *\\n*Only Belgium and hosts Russia have qualified so far *\\nA number of groups are tightly poised\\nEuropean qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia 2018™ is fast approaching its final straight, with a host of win-or-bust clashes looming large on the horizon. Only Belgium have guaranteed themselves a place at the tournament so far, but which other countries will join them?\\n*Group A: As it stands *France (17 points) and Sweden (16) are engaged in a tense battle for top spot, but the Netherlands (13), who have not yet given up on finishing second and reaching the play-offs, should not be discounted. Les Bleus are favourites to win in Bulgaria (12) and at home to Belarus (5), and if they do so, they will qualify as group winners. For Sweden, first up is a must-win game at home to Luxembourg (5 points), who recently held France to a memorable goalless draw in Toulouse. Sweden finish off their qualifying campaign with what could well be a decisive encounter in Amsterdam against the Oranje, who themselves travel to Belarus in their penultimate qualifier. Group B: As it stands* *Switzerland (24 points), who are, alongside Germany, one of only two nations in Europe yet to drop a point, will be focusing their attention on their all-important clash away to Portugal (21) on Matchday 10. La Nati can seal qualification beforehand, however, if Portugal fail to win in Andorra (4 points) and if they* *beat Hungary (10) at home. Any other set of results on Matchday 9 means that a head-to-head duel between the Swiss and the Portuguese will decide the winner of Group B.\\nGroup C: As it stands* *As previously mentioned, Germany (24 points) have a 100 per cent record so far, and many observers expect the current world champions to rubber-stamp their ticket to Russia on Matchday 9 away to Northern Ireland. Germany need just a point to do so and maintain their remarkable record of never having lost a World Cup qualifier away from home. Northern Ireland are already assured of second place but will give their all in Belfast, according to defender Gareth McAuley. \"Playing against Germany is a challenge to relish; these guys are on another level,\" said the West Bromwich Albion veteran. \"We know we\\'ll have to play a counter-attacking style of football against them. We\\'ve got that belief we can actually hurt them and it\\'s different in Belfast, a tight ground with the crowd behind us. We have nothing to lose.\"\\nGroup D: As it stands* *After their 1-0 win away to the Republic of Ireland in September, Serbia (18 points) have their sights firmly set on automatic qualification. A win either away to Austria (9) or at home to Georgia (5) will mean that they can start planning for Russia, likely leaving Wales (14) and the Republic of Ireland (13) to battle it out for second. The Welsh must go to Georgia while Ireland host Moldova (2), before a final, mouth-watering showdown between Wales and the Irish in Cardiff on 9 October.\\nGroup E: As it stands* *Following a first defeat for Poland (19 points) in qualifying (4-0 against Denmark in September), no fewer than three teams – the Poles, Denmark (16) and Montenegro (16) – are still in the running for top spot in Group E. Poland, currently top, travel to Armenia (6) before entertaining Montenegro. The Montenegrins host Denmark before travelling to Warsaw, and the Danes wrap up their qualifying campaign with a home game against Romania (9), who can no longer qualify.Group F: As it stands England (20 points) are unbeaten (six wins, two draws) and are heavy favourites to win the group. They will achieve that aim if they beat Slovenia (14) at home, although the Three Lions will have a second chance to seal qualification away to Lithuania (5) if they slip up on Matchday 9. Slovenia, Slovakia (15) and Scotland (14), meanwhile, are fighting it out to finish second, with two huge fixtures coming up in their mini-league: Scotland-Slovakia in Glasgow on 5 October and Slovenia-Scotland in Ljubljana three days later.\\nGroup G: As it stands\\nSpain’s 3-0 win against Italy in September appears to have decided the overall outcome of proceedings in Group G. The Spaniards (22 points) are top of the pile and three points clear of second, but they will be looking for a strong end to the campaign at home to Albania (13) and away in Israel (9). Italy (19), who are virtually guaranteed second, must win at home to Macedonia (7) and away to Albania, and simultaneously hope Spain drop points, in order to finish top. Albania retain only a theoretical chance of finishing second.Group H: As it stands Belgium (22 points), along with hosts Russia, are the only side in Europe to have already qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but the race for second could still involve a few twists and turns, with Bosnia and Herzegovina (14), Greece (13) and perhaps even Cyprus (10) still in contention. Cyprus and Greece face off in Nicosia on 7 October, while Greece complete the campaign at home to Gibraltar (0), a match the Greeks will be confident of winning. For Bosnia and Herzegovina, the deciding game will likely be their upcoming home clash with Belgium, before a final-day assignment away in Estonia (8).\\nGroup I: As it stands Could things be any tighter in this section? Croatia (16 points), Iceland (16), Turkey (14) and Ukraine (14) all retain a realistic chance of qualifying as group winners. Croatia host Finland (7) before a potential all-or-nothing clash away to Ukraine, while Iceland must travel to Turkey before their final game against Kosovo (1). Turkey must also go to Finland in their final game, and Ukraine cap off their campaign in Kosovo.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'Albania have a decisive role to play in Group G of the European qualifiers\\nChristian Panucci discusses the upcoming matches against Spain & Italy\\n“It was Fabio Capello who told me to move into coaching”\\nAlbania go into their final two games in the European qualifiers for the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ with virtually no chance of making it to the world finals. Third in a very demanding Group G, the Albanians are gearing up to face the two teams above them in the pool: Spain and Italy.\\nThe section’s big two would be well advised not to take Albania lightly, however, as their coach Christian Panucci explained. “They’re two very big matches for our players and we’re going to give it a go. That’s what you always have to try and do in life and in sport. We’ll try to make life hard for them. You never know in football.”\\nAs far as the Albania boss is concerned, these are no ordinary games: “They’re special matches, for sure. Spain is my second home. I spend a lot of time there, I’ve got friends there and I spent a very important part of my career in the country, which is close to my heart. And Italy is where I live. I made a lot of appearances for the national team too.”Did you know?\\nBorn in 1973 in Savona, Italy, he learned his trade in the Genoa youth ranks.\\nA first-choice right-back for Milan, Real Madrid, Inter and Roma, among others, through to his retirement in 2010 with Parma.\\nAmong the many trophies Panucci won were two UEFA Champions Leagues: in 1994 with Milan and with Real Madrid in 1998, the club’s seventh.\\nPanucci won 57 caps for Italy and appeared at Korea/Japan 2002.\\nRegards Fabio Capello as his mentor. Panucci followed him from Milan to Madrid and then began his coaching career with him.\\nWas Capello’s assistant with Russia’s national team, helping to take them to Brazil 2014. He also coached Livorno and Ternara in the Italian second division and took on the Albania job in July of this year.\\nHas since overseen the 2-0 defeat of Liechtenstein and the 1-1 draw with FYR Macedonia.\\nGiving an exclusive interview to FIFA.com, Panucci spoke of his objectives with Albania, the criticism aimed at Giampiero Ventura’s Italy and the influence of Capello on his career, among other topics.\\n*New objectives *“Gianni de Biasi did a fantastic job, and after qualifying for EURO 2016, Albania have gained a lot of respect in Europe and around the world. There’s a lot of positivity around. We have a good squad of players and I’m very happy. The aim is to qualify for EURO 2020 and we’re going to do all we can to make it. I think we can give it a good go, and I’m sure that Albania have a very bright future ahead of them.”\\n*No playing for a draw *“I like being brave in both victory and defeat, and we’re just going to see what happens against Spain and Italy. I don’t want my players to think that I’d be happy with a draw and to have everyone sit behind the ball (laughs). Avoiding defeat would be good though.”\\n*On Italy and the criticism of Ventura *“Spain beat Italy in that game (3-0), but Italy have won on many other occasions and I don’t think there’s much difference between the two. Every game is different. It’s not easy for Ventura. This is a transitional phase for Italy, there’s World Cup qualification at stake and he should be allowed to get on with the job. He’s a top coach with a lot of experience and he deserves respect.”\\n*Will we see Italy at Russia 2018? *“I don’t know. Italy are used to making it and the team’s still in with a chance of qualifying. I hope they make the finals; in fact, I’m sure they will. And when Italy get to a World Cup, they know how to make their way to the Final.”\\n*Taking Capello’s advice *“I always liked the idea, but he was the one who told me I had to be a coach. He took me with him to Russia, which was a fantastic experience, and that was when I started to give it some serious thought. You need to work hard if you want to make a success of being a coach. It’s a tough job, but I’m strong enough to give it a go. Let’s see what the future holds. I learned a lot of things from Capello but they’re all a secret (laughs). We all know his approach to his work and his mindset, which is one of the things that’s stayed with me in my career. He is a top professional.”'},\n",

The winners of each section will advance to France 2019, while the four second-placed teams with the best records will qualify for the play-offs (semi-finals and final). The team that emerges from the play-off final will become the eighth and final European qualifier, joining hosts France at the prestigious tournament.\\nGroups Group A: *Bosnia-Herzegovina, England, Kazakhstan, Russia, Wales Group B: Albania, Belarus, Poland, Scotland, Switzerland Group C: Ireland, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Norway, Slovakia Group D: Croatia, Denmark, Hungary, Sweden, Ukraine\\n*Group E: *Czech Republic, Faroe Islands, Germany, Iceland, Slovenia Group F: *Belgium, Italy, Moldova, Portugal, Romania\\n*Group G: *Austria, Finland, Israel, Serbia, Spain\\n**Highlights of the first two matchdays  Faroe Islands-Czech Republic, 14 September, 20.00 (local time)\\n*Given that Germany are likely to run away with things in Group E, the real suspense in the pool may stem from the battle for second place, but this initial fixture also has a certain symbolic value, as it officially signals the beginning of the group stage of the qualifying campaign for France 2019. The Faroes, like Albania, Israel, Kazakhstan and Moldova, all came through a preliminary group phase.** Germany-Slovenia, 16 September, 14.00 (local time)\\n*In the same section, much attention will be paid to the Germans’ opening match, particularly after the early exit they suffered at the recent UEFA European Women's Championship, a tournament they had previously won six times in a row. Led by Dzsenifer Marozsan, the only German woman nominated for The Best FIFA Women’s Player 2017, the Olympic champions will be keen to show that they are right to be considered as one of the favourites to lift the trophy in France.\\n* Italy-Moldova, 15 September, 20.30 (local time)\\n* Romania-Italy, 19 September, 17.00 (local time)\\nItaly have not graced the Women’s World Cup since 1999, and they were eliminated from the UEFA Women’s EURO 2017 at the group stage. One of the leading women’s national teams of the 1980s, La Nazionale have great hopes of qualifying for and making an impact at France 2019. In an open-looking group, they will need to get off to the best possible start, as Belgium and Portugal will also fancy their chances of claiming top spot.\\n** England-Russia, 19 September, 20.00 (local time)\\n*There was a time when England’s main ambition was simply to qualify for major tournaments, but that is clearly no longer the case. Having been the best European team at Canada 2015, where they finished third, and having reached the semi-finals of EURO 2017, their sights are now firmly set on securing the global crown. Earning maximum points at home will be crucial during this qualifying campaign; the Russians will need to be on their guard.\\n** Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland, 19 September, 20.30 (local time)\\n*In a Group C that contains European champions Netherlands and former world champions Norway, Ireland and Northern Ireland will doubtless be aware that finishing in first place is going to be a tall order. Defeating their closest neighbours, therefore, could provide a much-needed morale boost prior to the challenges that lie ahead.\"},\n",

Sweden, for their part, will do well to emerge unscathed from a couple of tricky tests on the road, first in Bulgaria and then in Belarus. It’s also worth remembering that the Netherlands, for all their early travails, remain just three points behind the leading duo.Group B: As it stands\\nA two-horse race has developed in this section, with eight points now separating second-place Portugal from Hungary in third. Switzerland, the only side besides Germany yet to drop a point, continue to lead and will be hopeful of maintaining their three-point advantage by seeing off Andorra (home) and Latvia (away). Portugal, though, have a good chance of staying within touching distance if Cristiano Ronaldo – with 11 goals in qualifying thus far – maintains his incredible rate of scoring once every 41 minutes on the road to Russia.\\nGroup C: As it stands\\nWith six straight wins, 27 goals scored and just one conceded, Germany have looked all but unstoppable in qualifying thus far. The world champions can, though, expect a stern examination in a tough upcoming double-header that sees them travel to Prague to face Czech Republic before welcoming Norway to Stuttgart. It’s crunch time for the Czechs, meanwhile. After facing the Germans, they will head to Belfast to take on second-placed Northern Ireland, with victory all but essential.Group D: As it stands\\nAll eyes will be on Dublin in this section as the top two, Serbia and Republic of Ireland, go head-to-head on Tuesday. The Irish have faltered somewhat after an outstanding start, picking up just two points from a possible six in their most recent fixtures – both at home – and face a tough trip to Georgia before taking on the Serbians. Their visitors currently lead on goal difference and will expect to take maximum points at home to Moldova before heading to the Irish capital. Wales and Austria - four points adrift of the leading duo - face off in Cardiff on Saturday, with only the victors likely to remain in contention.\\nGroup E: As it stands\\nPoland and 11-goal Robert Lewandowski have proved unbeatable thus far, but face arguably their toughest test yet on Friday against a rejuvenated Denmark in Copenhagen. The Danes, in truth, are focused more on pipping Montenegro to second place - with both currently tied on ten points - than catching the Poles. Age Hareide’s side will be looking to halt the leaders, win in Armenia and hope that the Montenegrins slip up against Kazakhstan (away) or Romania (home).Group F: As it stands\\nSlovakia remain England’s closest challengers in this section, but their credentials will be tested by a double-header that sees them welcome third-placed Slovenia before heading to Wembley. Any slip-ups could open the door for the Slovenians, or for Scotland, who nonetheless know that anything less than six points against Lithuania and Malta will consign their campaign to failure.\\nGroup G: As it stands\\nWith Albania and Israel seven points adrift, it’s all about Spain and Italy in this section, with Saturday’s Bernabeu showdown arguably the most anticipated 2018 qualifier thus far. It was impossible to separate these former world champions when they drew 1-1 in Turin last October, and a win for either in Madrid – with *La Roja *currently leading only on goal difference – would surely prove decisive.Group H: As it stands\\nHaving put the first dent in Belgium’s bid with a 1-1 away draw in March, Greece take on the leaders in Piraeus on Sunday aiming to cut a lead that currently stands at four points. Bosnia and Herzegovina, a point further back, remain in the hunt too and will expect to boost their chances of a top-two finish with victories on the road against Cyprus and Gibraltar.\\nGroup I: As it stands\\nAfter Iceland’s dramatic win over Croatia in June left the pair level on points at the section’s summit, the joint-leaders must now focus on holding off those below them. Turkey and Ukraine lie just two points off the pace and, with the former playing host to the Croatians and the latter travelling to Reykjavik, any one of these four sides could be in pole position this time next week.'},\n",

Georgia coach Vladimir Weiss clearly did not believe all was lost, however, throwing on two attack-minded substitutes, who both found the net in the second period.\\nUnbeaten in Dublin in competitive matches since 1993, Republic of Ireland looked as if they were going to allow that record to slip away when Austria opened the scoring in the 31st minute, a lead they held until five minutes from time. Martin O’Neill’s charges salvaged a point through Jonathan Walters, who lashed home a right-footed half-volley from just inside the Austrian box. \\nWales, meanwhile, also went ahead away from home after Aaron Ramsey’s Panenka-style penalty putting the visitors 1-0 up against Serbia. But the Beli Orlovi did not allow their heads to go down, as Aleksandar Mitrovic stroked in an equaliser in the 73rd minute. \\nGroup G\\nSpain and Italy warmed up for their big head-to-head meeting in September by both picking up three points and remaining joint leaders of Group G. While La Roja, who went ahead via goals by David Silva and Diego Costa and then allowed their resilient opponents back into the match, found the going a little tough at times, it was plain sailing for the Azzurri*, *who comfortably saw off Liechtenstein 5-0 in Udine. \\nFurther down the table, Albania moved into third position after a convincing win in Israel.

Iceland share the lead with Croatia following their victory in Reykjavik. Turkey, who performed impressively in Kosovo (4-1) are third, level on goal difference with fourth-placed Ukraine, who dug deep to win 2-1 in Finland. \\nUnfortunately, as of this round of games, winless Kosovo and Finland are now mathematically eliminated from the race for Russia 2018.Player of the day\\nSpain extended their remarkable unbeaten record in World Cup qualifying matches to 59 (Denmark were the last team to defeat them on 31 March 1993), and they did so with the help of David Silva, who scored an eye-catching opener in Skopje.

Against Athletic Bilbao in 2015, Sevilla the following year and Alaves this one, the Brazilian netted Barcelona’s second goal in a victory. Lionel Messi was also on target on Saturday, becoming the first player to score in four Copa del Rey deciders since Telmo Zarra bagged in his fifth in 1950. The result made Barcelona the first side to win three straight Copa Del Rey crowns since 1953, when they themselves, inspired by Ladislao Kubala, did it, and saw Luis Enrique leave Camp Nou having won all six of his single-match finals in the hot-seat.26successive seasons had astonishingly ended with the Bundesliga producing the most goals per game in Europe’s top five leagues – until it came third in 2016/17. The last time the German top flight had not been the most prolific of the quintet was in 1989/90, when it came second (2.53 goals per game) to the English one (2.6), whose figure was indebted to Gary Lineker, John Barnes, Kerry Dixon, Matt Le Tissier, David Platt, Ian Rush and Rod Wallace scoring 140 goals between them. The Bundesliga, which averaged a whopping 3.16 goals per game in 2013/14 – and that despite no player scoring more than 20 goals – managed 2.87 this term. That would usually have been enough, but La Liga averaged 2.94 and Serie A – the birthplace of Catenaccio – 2.96. A whopping 44 goals in the final round (4.4 per game) saw the Italian top tier record its highest tally (1,123) since 1950/51 (1,192).7goals in six appearances at Wembley is Alexis Sanchez’s proud record after his opener helped Arsenal upset Chelsea 2-1 in the FA Cup final. *‘El Niño Maravilla’ *scored both Chile’s goals as they beat England 2-0 at the hallowed London venue in a 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil™ warm-up, and has netted five in as many games there – all victories – for the Gunners. Victor Moses handicapped the Blues by becoming just the fifth player to be sent off in an FA Cup final after Kevin Moran, Jose Antonio Reyes, Pablo Zabaleta and Chris Smalling, with Aaron Ramsey, who hit the winner the penultimate time his club played in the fixture, repeating the feat. That resulted in Arsenal outranking Manchester United to become the FA Cup’s outright record champions (13 titles) and Arsene Wenger surpassing George Ramsay as its most successful manager (seven).6matches without victory in the FIFA U-20 World Cup is what record six-time champions Argentina fell on to in Korea – amazingly after going ten years without defeat in the competition. After Pablo Zabaleta, Lucas Biglia, Lionel Messi and Co lost 1-0 to a Freddy Adu-inspired USA in their Netherlands 2005 curtain-raiser, the Argentinians went 19 games without losing – one shy of the all-time record held by Brazil – until a 3-2 reverse by Ghana in 2015. Argentina carried a four-match winless streak into Korea Republic 2017, and began it with back-to-back losses by England and the hosts. Argentina extinguished the possibility of going seven matches without a win at the tournament for the first time with a 5-0 thrashing of Guinea, but it was insufficient to prevent them making it opening-round exits at back-to-back U-20 World Cups for the first time.4consecutive league-and-cup doubles is what Red Bull Salzburg became only the third European team in history to achieve. Dinamo Tirana were the first, between 1950 and ’53 in Albania, while Dinamo Tbilisi – inspired by Kakha Kaladze, Georgi Kinkladze and Giorgi Demetradze – conquered Georgia’s two biggest trophies in six successive seasons from 1992 to ’97. Salzburg edged Altach on the final day of the Austrian Bundesliga on Sunday to finish 18 points clear on 81 points – the second-highest total in the competition’s history. They consequently tied Austria Vienna’s record of winning four straight Bundesliga titles, set between 1978 and ’81. The side coached by Oscar Garcia, who played alongside his brother Roger for Barcelona in the 1990s, then beat Rapid Vienna 2-1 in the Austrian Cup final on Thursday. The 1933-founded club had never won the tournament until 2012, but have now conquered five of the last six editions. Salzburg have also won their last 22 matches in the Austrian Cup, scoring 102 goals and conceding just 16.\\nQuick hits 11 Czech Golden Balls now belong to Petr Cech.

At the beginning of April, the qualifying campaign in Europe that will run until September 2018 kicked off. From 6-11 April the first matches for the world's foremost women's tournament took place and five nations – Kazakhstan, Albania, Israel, Moldova and Faroe Islands - all overcame the first hurdle en route to the competition.\\n*Group 1: Kazakhstan reach qualifying group stage  *Just as they did four years ago, Kazakhstan managed to book their place in the UEFA qualifying group stage for the Women's World Cup. They did so thanks to a 1-0 victory over Georgia, a 2-2 draw with Latvia and a 1-0 triumph over Estonia. The latter, who also progressed from the preliminary round four years ago, suffered three defeats this time.\\nFinal standings:\\n1. Kazakhstan (7 points)*\\n2. Latvia (5)\\n3. Georgia (4)\\n4. Estonia (0)Group 2: Albania impress once again\\nThe spotlight was trained firmly on Kosovo going in this group, with the side participating in their first ever competitive matches. However, defeats to Albania (3-2), Greece (6-0) and Malta (3-1) ultimately left the newcomers empty-handed. Albania, taking part for a second time, reached the qualifying group stage once again and even managed to do so as group winners. Victories over Kosovo and Greece (2-1), as well as a goalless draw with Malta, ensured coach Armir Grimaj's side took top spot.\\nFinal standings:\\n1. Albania (7 points)*\\n2. Greece (6)\\n3. Malta (4)\\n4. Kosovo (0)\\nGroup 3: Israel and Moldova continue to dream\\nTwo teams from this pool can begin their preparations for the qualifying group stage. Both Israel and Moldova recorded victories over Lithuania and Andorra and drew 0-0 when they went head-to-head, meaning they each finished with seven points to occupy the top two spots. Competition debutants Andorra finished bottom of the group. Coach Jose Antonio Martin, who has been in charge of the women's national team since June last year, could not prevent his side losing 4-0 to Moldova in their opening fixture. That was followed by a 7-0 reverse against Israel and a 2-0 loss to Lithuania.\\nFinal standings:\\n1. Israel (7)*\\n2. Moldova (7)*\\n3. Lithuania (3)\\n4. Andorra (0)\\n*Group 4: Down to the wire *The battle for top spot in this group turned into a two-horse race between Turkey and Faroe Islands, a contest that was only decided in the final round of matches when the sides locked horns directly. Both teams went into the encounter on the back of two victories, and the match itself was an evenly balanced affair. Turkey edged ahead in the 17th minute through Melike Pekel but Rannva Andreasen equalised before the break. Milja Simonsen went on to score the winner in a 2-1 victory for Faroe Islands, simultaneously breaking Turkish hearts by stopping them reaching the next qualifying round.\\nFinal standings:\\n1. Faroe Islands (9)*\\n2. Turkey (6)\\n3. Montenegro (3)\\n4. Luxembourg (0)* These five teams qualify alongside the 30 best nations to form seven groups of five. The draw will take place on 25 April 2017 and the fixtures, including home and away ties, will be played between 11 September 2017 and 4 September 2018.\"},\n",

Several new, and as yet, unknown teams will be joining the traditional heavyweights this time around.\\nIn Group 1, Georgia and Latvia will be hoping to progress to the group stage after missing out four years ago.

Intensity was certainly not lacking, unlike clear-cut scoring opportunities, which were few and far between. Neither goalkeeper was truly tested in the first half, with both teams cancelling each other out and struggling to play a telling final ball.\\nAfter having been nullified during the first 45 minutes, Gareth Bale began to find space and angles after the break, causing the watching Irish fans to break out in a cold sweat on more than one occasion. The dismissal of Neil Taylor complicated matters for the Welsh, but the Irish, propelled by Shane Long, were unable to find a way through their opponents’ resilient rearguard, despite coming close through James McClean. \\n* Elsewhere *Serbia sent a strong message to their rivals in Group D by coming from behind to pull off a 3-1 win in Georgia. Dusan Tadic, who has been on excellent form during this qualifying campaign, was involved in all three goals, scoring the equaliser from the penalty spot and setting up the other two. Austria, meanwhile, secured a hard-earned victory over Moldova (2-0) and remain in the hunt for a spot at Russia 2018. \\nGroup G top stories\\nSpain and Italy both scored within the opening quarter of an hour to remove any element of doubt in their comfortable home wins over Israel (4-1) and Albania (2-0), respectively. In doing so, they maintained their unbeaten record and their shared lead at the top of Group G, and increased the likelihood that their duel on 2 September will decide the outcome of the pool. In the other match, FYR Macedonia made light work of Liechtenstein (3-0) to leave Rene Pauritsch’s men rooted to the bottom of the table.\\n\\nGroup I top stories \\nIn Group I, Turkey emerged from their home game with Finland with three points (2-0), courtesy of two early Cenk Tosun goals and some solid defending thereafter. The Turks can still entertain legitimate hopes of qualifying and even winning the section, while the Scandinavians, who lacked penetration throughout, have taken just one point from five matches. Croatia played well to defeat Ukraine 1-0 – via a superb first-half goal by Nikola Kalinic – and to retain top spot ahead of Iceland, who got back on track with a closely contested 2-1 success in Kosovo.\\n* Player of the day Spain have been quietly impressive during their qualifying campaign for Russia 2018, and currently look a good bet to make up for their premature exit at Brazil 2014. Sergio Ramos, Gerard Pique and Andres Iniesta all played a part in *La Roja’s 4-1 triumph over Israel, but it was *David Silva who stood out, demonstrating his trademark dribbles and nose for goal. In addition, the 31-year-old attacking midfielder nabbed the opener for the Spaniards in Gijon – his 29th international strike, a total that moves him up to joint fourth (level with Fernando Hierro) in his country’s all-time scoring charts.* *\\nThe stat\\n1,000 – The number of professional matches in which Gianluigi Buffon *has now competed, following Italy’s match with Albania on Friday. The legendary goalkeeper, aged 39, also surpassed the number of international caps amassed by his Spanish counterpart Iker Casillas (168 to 167), a European record. Yet another clean sheet represented the icing on the cake for the veteran custodian. **\\n*Did you know? *One of the curious quirks of the Republic of Ireland-Wales encounter in Group D was the number of players who are usually team-mates at club level but who found themselves on opposite sides of the pitch on Friday. James McCarthy and Ashley Williams play together at Everton, as do Darren Randolph and James Collins at West Ham United, Stephen Ward, Jeff Hendrick and Sam Vokes play for Burnley, James McClean and Hal Robson-Kanu are West Bromwich Albion team-mates, and Glenn Whelan, Jonathan Walters and Joe Allen are Stoke City players.\\n* What they said \"We knew they were going to set up like that, make it very difficult for us to get on the ball. In the first half, they definitely did that. In the second half, I thought we controlled the game very well. We created some good chances and we were unlucky not to get a goal. If you look at the last 20 minutes, playing with ten men, a point is not the worst result.\"\\n*Wales winger Gareth Bale on his side\\'s 0-0 draw with Republic of Ireland in Dublin'},\n",

The 29-year-old Belgium winger, playing as a makeshift forward in sky blue, followed up a treble in the 5-0 win at Cagliari with a quartet in the 5-3 victory over Torino on Sunday. Mertens duly became the first Napoli player to bag four times in a Serie A game since Giuseppe Savoldi against Foggia exactly 39 years earlier. Mertens has now managed more league goals in his last two appearances as he did in each of the previous two seasons.21years was the Brazil career span that Formiga ended in style on Sunday. The multifunctional midfielder made her international debut, as a 17-year-old, on the grandest platform of all in 1995: at the FIFA Women’s World Cup™. Formiga is one of only two women to play in all six instalments of that competition – Japan’s Homare Sawa is the other – and the oldest to score in it. Furthermore, she is the only player to participate in all six Olympic Women’s Football Tournaments. Before winning her 160th and final cap against Italy, Formiga cried through the Brazilian national anthem. Then she helped *A Seleção *beat Italy 5-3 to win their sixth straight Torneio Internacional title in an event that marked Emily Lima’s first appearance at their reins.1goal in his last 12 games is what Iago Aspas boasts. The 29-year-old forward went into 2016/17 having scored just 16 goals in his previous 65 league matches, and it took him six outings to break his duck for the season. The Celta Vigo No10 has, however, been on fire thereafter, hitting nine goals in as many appearances in La Liga – only Lionel Messi and Luis Saurez have more than his ten – and two in two in the UEFA Europa League. Iago also netted after coming on as sub for his Spain debut at Wembley, helping secure a dramatic 2-2 draw. The former Liverpool player's latest gave Celta a second-half lead at Athletic Bilbao, but they lost 2-1 and have now gone ten league games without a clean sheet.3trophies is what Zinedine Zidane has won within a year of assuming the Real Madrid reins – astonishingly compared to just two defeats. A thrilling 4-2 defeat of Kashima Antlers saw the 1998 FIFA World Cup™ headliner add the FIFA Club World Cup to the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Super Cup titles he won earlier this year. *Los Blancos *were undone by Atletico Madrid and Wolfsburg early on in Zidane’s tenure, but have not lost since, with Sunday’s victory in Yokohama taking them on to 37 matches without defeat. It was the first time both teams had scored in the Club World Cup final in seven years, and its joint-highest-scoring decider in history, equalling AC Milan’s 4-2 sinking of Boca Juniors in 2007. Real also became just the second side to lift the trophy after trailing in its decider. Barcelona became the first seven years ago, with Pedro’s last-gasp goal taking their clash with Estudiantes into extra-time, where Lionel Messi grabbed the winner. The victory was indebted to Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the first man to bag a hat-trick in the fixture. It also saw Brazil finally lose the distinction of being the competition’s record winners, with Spain outranking them by moving on to five crowns.0defeats at home is what Borussia Dortmund have managed in a calendar year for only the third time. Hans Tilkowski, Wolfgang Paul, Siggi Held, Lothar Emmerich, Friedhelm Konietzka and Co helped BVB achieve the feat in 1965, while Jens Lehmann, Christoph Metzelder, Stefan Reuter, Tomas Rosicky, Lars Ricken, Jan Koller and Amoroso repeated it in 2002. Thomas Tuchel’s team fell 1-0 behind for the seventh game in succession on Tuesday, but an Ousmane Dembele goal gave them their fourth consecutive score draw. The result left Dortmund unbeaten at Signal Iduna Park in 29 Bundesliga outings, and having won 17 and drawn eight of their fixtures there in all competitions in 2016. Dortmund have, however, failed to win their last match of the year on the last five occasions.\\nQuick hits 90A-League goals is what Victory striker Besart Berisha moved on to by hitting the winner in the Melbourne Derby on Saturday, equalling Archie Thompson’s all-time record.\\n67 per cent of the last nine penalties he’s faced in Ligue 1 have been saved by Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic after his denial of Lyon’s Alexandre Lacazette on Sunday.\"},\n",

The former team had impressed observers in France and could consider themselves unfortunate to have been ousted by eventual champions Portugal in the Round of 16, while the latter side reached the quarter-finals after sensationally defeating England in the previous round.\\nHowever, in four previous meetings, Strákarnir okkar had never beaten the Croatians, losing three times and drawing once, with just one goal scored and nine conceded. And although their status has clearly changed since their unexpected European Championship exploits, their fans will have to wait until next time to see this undesirable trend reversed.\\nThe Vatreni demonstrated their technical superiority throughout, but even more so in the move that led to the opening goal, Marcelo Brozovic taking a fine flick from Ivan Rakitic in his stride and curling the ball skilfully into the net from the edge of the box. The Inter Milan midfielder added a second strike late on, picking up a pass from Luka Modric on the halfway line and surging forward to slot it past the Icelandic goalkeeper and send his side clear at the top of the pool.\\nElsewhere\\nGroup D also featured an encounter between two EURO 2016 participants, as Ireland continued their fine run of form by clinching a 1-0 win in Austria, who have struggled since failing to win a game in France. James McClean got the all-important goal in Vienna, which sent the Irish to the summit of the section.\\nIn Georgia, meanwhile, the home side seemed on the verge of their first success in the group following Valeri Kazaishvili’s early opener, but a memorable volley from Aleksandru Gatcan 12 minutes from time helped ensure that Moldova would leave Tbilisi with a point – their first of the campaign.\\nLast but not least, Wales looked to have done enough against Serbia, but Gareth Bale’s goal was cancelled out in the final few minutes by Aleksandar Mitrovic.\\nIn Group G, Italy and Spain did as was expected of them versus Liechtenstein and FYR Macedonia respectively, although it took La Roja much longer than La Nazionale to properly seal their victory. Back in third spot but still in the hunt, Israel have not given up on their qualification dream just yet, taking three points from their clash with an Albania team that finished with nine men.\\nThe other two matches in Group I saw Turkey and Ukraine emerge victorious from hard-fought duels with Kosovo and Finland. The Turks made hard work of the first half, and had to wait until the 51st minute to make the breakthrough against the stuffy newcomers. The Ukrainians’ tight 1-0 win enabled them to leapfrog Iceland into second place, behind Croatia.\\nPlayer of the day\\nKosovo are currently competing in their first-ever World Cup qualifying campaign, which inevitably makes them one of the least experienced teams in Europe. However, that is not the case for goalkeeper Samir Ujkani, who played in 12 qualifiers for Albania in the run-up to South Africa 2010 and Brazil 2014. Calling upon that experience and unfazed by the raucous Turkish crowd, he put in an extremely composed performance in the Antalya Arena on Saturday.\\nIn the first half, he consistently repelled Turkey’s attacks, saving efforts by Selcuk Inan, Volkan Sen, Hakan Calhanoglu and Burak Yilmaz. However, despite his obvious talent between the sticks, Ujkani, who has played the entirety of his club career in Italy (since 2007), is not a miracle worker, and he could do nothing to prevent the Kosovans from conceding two quick and crucial goals at the start of the second period.\\nDid you know?\\nIreland had not beaten Austria in their last eight meetings, losing six times and drawing twice, but McClean rounded off a quick Irish attack to bring that unwanted run to an end. Wales, meanwhile had never beaten Serbia in 11 attempts (eight defeats and three draws) and entertained real hopes of ending that hoodoo once their talisman, Gareth Bale, had scored the opener – his 11th goal in 14 matches – in the 30th minute. But Mitrovic, who headed an equaliser in the 86th minute, had other ideas.\\n*What they said*\\n“I am very satisfied; we were still attacking in the 94th minute. This is the proof that we are taking steps in the right direction. We were very good today, and yes, I would have definitely signed up for a win like this before the game,” Italy coach Giampiero Ventura.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"THE DAY REPLAYED – Has Andriy Yarmolenko been taking showboat classes from Ronaldinho? Is there anybody more terrifying to mark than Aleksandar Mitrovic? Was that Nordic UEFA EURO fairy tale really a fairy tale? Is any player in Europe better at scoring headers than Gareth Bale? Has anyone told Paolo Di Canio he’s not the only Italian who can score both-feet-in-the-air volleys?\\nWe’re unsure, but we are sure that Icelanders, the Irish, Italians, Serbs and Spaniards are very happy tonight. *FIFA.com *recaps another entertaining evening in Europe.\\nResults\\nGroup D: Moldova 1-3 Republic of Ireland, Serbia 3-2 Austria, Wales 1-1 Georgia\\nGroup G: Albania 0-2 Spain, FYR Macedonia 2-3 Italy, Israel 2-1 Liechtenstein\\n*Group I: *Finland 0-1 Croatia, Iceland 2-0 Turkey, Ukraine 3-0 Kosovo\\n*Match of the day *\\n*FYR Macedonia 2-3 Italy *\\nNestorovsdki 57, Hasani 59; Belotti 24, Immobile 75 & 92\\n‘The Rooster’ announced his arrival on the international stage stylishly. Airbound, Andrea Belotti struck Italy ahead. Macedonia were, nevertheless, unfortunate to go in 1-0 down, but their pressure finally paid off when quick-fire goals swung them in front. Rather than attempt to protect their advantage, Goran Pandev and Co continued taking the game to their illustrious guests and only the stunning, age-defying reflexes of 38-year-old Gigi Buffon kept Italy alive. Macedonia were just 15 minutes away from their footballing zenith when Ciro Immobile equalised. Then, in stoppage time, the man from the picturesque city of Torre Annunziata broke Macedonian hearts. What a game!\\nElsewhere\\nEtrit Berisha produced a regal first-half display to exasperate several Spaniards, but it was the goalie’s gaffe that gifted the South Africa 2010 champions the opener, with David Silva selflessly allowing Diego Costa to score it. Nolito, just minutes after coming on, sealed the deal in style to keep Spain above Italy on goal difference. Albania are only a point back, level with Israel. Tomer Hemed’s brace took him on to 15 goals in 21 internationals and earned Elisha Levy’s team a close but comfortable 2-1 defeat of Liechtenstein.\\nBale moved three behind Ian Rush on Wales’ list of all-time leading marksmen by bagging another header, but that’s where the fun finished for the Dragons. Tornike Okriashvili equalised, Levan Mchedlidze spurned a gilt-edged chance, and Valeri Kazaishvili smashed the crossbar as Georgia grabbed a point that arguably flattered their hosts. A side from across the Irish sea fared far better. James McClean was the two-goal hero as the Republic were worth every cent of their 3-1 win in Chisinau. Martin O'Neill’s men were joined on points at the Group D summit by Serbia, who took the lead three times in a riveting reverse of Austria. Mitrovic stroked home their first and headed home their second, before Dusan Tadic employed pristine technique to volley in the winner.\\nCroatia and Iceland climbed on to seven points from three games at the top of Group I. Mario Mandzukic’s tap-in header claimed Ante Cacic’s charges victory in Tampere, while Alfred Finnbogason’s volley helped those Thierry Henry described as “everybody’s second-favourite team” beat Turkey 2-0. Ukraine are two points off the pace in third. Their victory over Kosovo in Krakow was foreseen. The party pieces provided by Yarmolenko, and wonder goals from the aforementioned and Ruslam Rotan, were cherished.\\n*Player of the day *\\n“Mitrovic doesn’t need to score to be the best player on the pitch – he chases lost causes, bullies defenders, dominates in the air and brings team-mates into play,” said Serbia coach Slavoljub Muslin in the build-up to Austria hitting Belgrade. The 22-year-old innately did all that (a few Austrians will be sore in the morning!). He also netted twice. Now that’s double value.\\n*The number *\\n89 per cent is Mario Mandzukic’s strike rate for Croatia in 2016 – not bad considering he failed to score at UEFA EURO 2016. The 30-year-old owes Andrej Kramaric a beer for his latest – the 25-year-old’s shot was merely inches from going in when the Juventus striker got his head on it. Kramaric had already jogged of to celebrate ‘his’ goal and only discovered it had been awarded to his team-mate after the game! Mandzukic’s eighth goal in nine internationals this year left him on 28 – one shy of second-placed Eduardo da Silva on Croatia’s list of all-time leading marksmen. Davor Suker, whose classy finishing thrust Croatia to bronze at France 1998, heads it on 45.\\nDid you know?\\nTwo goals within 142 seconds had Italy en route to losing a World Cup or EURO qualifier for the first time in 53 games until Immobile turned saviour.\\nQuote\\nGiampiero Ventura: “Ninety per cent of our mistakes came from carelessness, but we gave a great response after that double blow. It takes a strong-minded team to come back from that. And we must not forget the contribution of Buffon.”\"},\n",

       "   'content': \"THE DAY REPLAYED–* *The much-anticipated FIFA World Cup™ qualifying clash between Italy and Spain lived up to expectations in terms of intensity, but the final score – a 1-1 draw – did not suit either team and enabled Albania to move to the top of Group G. Elsewhere, Croatia made light work of Kosovo, while Iceland pulled off a dramatic win in stoppage time.\\nFIFA.com reviews the action from Thursday’s UEFA qualifiers.\\nResultsGroup D: Austria 2-2 Wales, Republic of Ireland 1-0 Georgia, Moldova 0-3 Serbia\\nGroup G: Italy 1-1 Spain, Liechtenstein 0-2 Albania, FYR Macedonia 1-2 Israel \\nGroup I: Kosovo 0-6 Croatia, Iceland 3-2 Finland, Turkey 2-2 Ukraine \\nMatch of the dayItaly 1-1 Spain*\\n*Victor Vitolo 55’ (Spain); Daniele De Rossi 82’ (Italy)\\n*The atmosphere was electric at Juventus Stadium for the 36th confrontation between the European powerhouses of Italy and Spain, which also happened to be their first-ever meeting in World Cup qualifying. After having been swept aside by Italy in the Round of 16 of UEFA EURO 2016, *La Roja went into attack mode right from the outset of the encounter, but struggled to create truly threatening opportunities despite completely dominating possession. \\nIn the end, it was a huge, uncharacteristic mistake by Gianluigi Buffon that led to the deadlock being broken. The veteran goalkeeper, who had not had much to do up to that point, mistimed his attempt to clear a through ball from midfield and let in Victor Vitolo, who could not quite believe his luck as he rolled the ball into an empty net (55', 0-1). \\nThis incident appeared to bring La Nazionale back to life, and a series of attacks on the Spain goal eventually culminated in Eder being awarded a penalty, which Daniele De Rossi converted with aplomb.\\nElsewhereWales were forced to settle for just one point in Austria, despite having led at half-time. A second-half strike from Marko Arnautovic, his second of the match, put a spanner in the works for Chris Coleman’s men, but the 2-2 draw still maintains their spot at the summit of Group D. In second place lie Serbia, who recorded a resounding 3-0 victory in Moldova, while Ireland beat Georgia 1-0 at home courtesy of a slightly fortunate Seamus Coleman goal. \\nIn Group G, meanwhile, Albania registered their second consecutive win against Liechtenstein (2-0) to take sole possession of first place above Spain and Italy. Israel came out on top of a closely contested duel with FYR Macedonia (2-1), who missed a penalty towards the end. \\nThere was action and turnarounds galore in Group I, where Kosovo, fresh from claiming a historic point in Finland, found the going tough at home to a rampant Croatia, for whom Mario Mandzukic notched a hat-trick in a 6-0 success. \\nCroatia now sit on top of the section, ahead of Iceland, who were involved in an incredible denouement at home to Finland, scoring in the last minute and then again in injury time to secure a memorable 3-2 triumph and earn a trademark 'thunderclap' from their supporters. Finally, Ukraine may harbour some regrets from their trip to Turkey, having led 2-0 within half an hour but eventually drawing 2-2.\\nPlayer of the dayDeprived of a number of regular starters, Croatia relied on a top-notch performance from Mario Mandzukic to dispose of Kosovo. Despite finding playing time hard to come by at Juventus this season due to the excellent form of Gonzalo Higuain and Paulo Dybala, the 30-year-old striker demonstrated that he had lost none of his sharpness, opening the scoring with a fine chipped finish and later adding two headers to complete a first-half hat-trick. \\nThe number 15 – Few would argue against Gareth Bale being a crucial component in Wales’ starting XI, but the team's statistics reveal how essential he really is. Since September 2014, the Real Madrid star has been directly involved in over half of the Dragons’ goals: out of 28 total goals, Bale has scored 12 and set up three.\\nDid you know?Andriy Yarmolenko and Hakan Calhanoglu put in mirror-image performances on Thursday evening: the former opened the scoring for Ukraine from the penalty spot prior to providing an assist for his country’s second goal, while the latter set up Turkey’s first and then put away a penalty to equalise.\"},\n",

       "   'content': \"*THE DAY REPLAYED *– On Tuesday evening, several of the final ten matches in the first round of European qualifiers for the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ – including the abandoned game between Albania and FYR Macedonia – kept fans on the edge of their seats well into stoppage time. While traditional outsiders such as Belarus, Luxembourg and Andorra gave a particularly good account of themselves against more established teams, UEFA EURO 2016 finalists Portugal and France made a disappointing start on the road to Russia.\\nResults\\nGroup A: Sweden 1-1 Netherlands, Bulgaria 4-3 Luxembourg, Belarus 0-0 France\\nGroup B: Faroe Islands 0-0 Hungary, Switzerland 2-0 Portugal, Andorra 0-1 Latvia\\nGroup G: *Albania 2-1 FYR Macedonia\\nGroup H:* Gibraltar 1-4 Greece, Cyprus 0-3 Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina 5-0 Estonia\\nMatch of the day\\nSwitzerland 2-0 Portugal\\nEmbolo 23’, Mehmedi 30’\\nDespite travelling to Basel full of confidence, newly-crowned European champions Portugal were brought down to earth with a bump within half an hour of kick-off as Breel Embolo and Admir Mehmedi put Die Eidgenossen on track for victory. While the Selecção das Quinas threw everything forward in the second half despite the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo and Renato Sanches, they were unable to overcome the staunch Swiss defence.\\nElsewhere\\nSwitzerland’s victory leaves them at the top of Group B ahead of Latvia, who won 1-0 in Andorra, while the Faroe Islands and Hungary played out a goalless draw.\\nBulgaria are the surprise leaders in Group A after the first round of matches as favourites France and the Netherlands had to be content with 0-0 and 1-1 stalemates against Belarus and Sweden respectively.\\nAfter being abandoned due to bad weather at 1-1 on Monday evening, the match between Albania and FYR Macedonia in Group G ended 2-1 to the hosts on Tuesday afternoon, with Bekim Bala scoring the winner shortly before the final whistle.\\nGroup H boasted the most goals in the opening round of European qualifying with a total of 13 strikes in three matches as Greece beat FIFA newcomers Gibraltar 4-1. Meanwhile Belgium, previously ranked first in the FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking, eased past Cyprus 3-0 thanks to a brace from Romelu Lukaku in the 13th and 61st minutes and an 81st-minute goal from Yannick Carrasco. Bosnia and Herzegovina recorded the round’s second highest win by thrashing Estonia 5-0, with only Spain finding the target more often in their 8-0 triumph over Liechtenstein.\\nPlayer of the day\\n*Gibraltar midfielder *Liam Walker made history when he scored an equaliser at 1-1 in the match against Greece, netting his country’s first-ever goal in a competitive FIFA match. Unfortunately his joy was short-lived, as the Ethniki scored three times in three minutes to reach their eventual winning scoreline of 4-1 by the end of the first half.\\nThe number\\n*60 – *Luxembourg were just 60 seconds away from securing their first point in 13 matches against Bulgaria when Alexsandar Tonev scored in the 92nd minute to hand the Eastern European hosts a 4-3 win. Dimitar Rangelov opened the scoring for Bulgaria after 16 minutes before Luxembourg’s Aurelien Joachim turned the match in the Red Lions' favour with a brace in the 60th and 62nd minutes, only for Marcelinho to level the scores three minutes later. Although Florian Bohnert appeared to seal a precious point for Luxembourg in the 91st minute, Tonev soon dashed their hopes once and for all.\\nDid you know?\\nAny teams facing Belgium in their opening World Cup qualifier could be forgiven for being nervous, as the Red Devils are now unbeaten in 14 opening matches on the road to major international tournaments. Their last false start was a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Sweden back in 1960.\"},\n",

       "   'content': 'THE DAY REPLAYED - A galloping Welshman proved unplayable. Two goalkeepers proved infallible. A few Spaniards proved goal-thirsty. Penalties, missed penalties and a series of first international goals proved pivotal on an entertaining night of FIFA World Cup™ qualifiers in Europe. Here, *FIFA.com *wraps it up.\\nResults *\\n*Group D: *Georgia 1-2 Austria, Serbia 2-2 Republic of Ireland, Wales 4-0 Moldova\\n*Group G: *Israel 1-3 Italy, Spain 8-0 Liechtenstein\\n*Group I: Croatia 1-1 Turkey, Finland 1-1 Kosovo, Ukraine 1-1 Iceland\\n*Note: *Albania-Macedonia was abandoned, with the score at 1-1, due to heavy storms and will be concluded on Tuesday.\\n*Match of the day *\\nIsrael 1-3 Italy\\n*Pelle 16, Candreva (pen) 31, Ben Haim 35, Immobile 83 *\\nA Graziano Pelle tap-in and an Antonio Candreva penalty had Italy cruising, but two uncharacteristic howlers from Giorgio Chiellini turned the game on its head. First the 32-year-old gifted possession to Tal Ben Haim, who sumptuously chipped Gianluigi Buffon to halve the deficit. Then Chiellini pocketed a second yellow card and a consequent red that will rule him out of next month’s decisive showdown with Spain. Isreal took the game to their opponents thereafter, and Italy required Buffon to perform heroics and Marco Verratti to play through the pain barrier – Giampiero Ventura had used all three substitutions – to keep them ahead. The pressure was relentless until a fine goal from Ciro Immobile put the game to bed late on.\\nElsewhere\\nJulen Lopetegui observed that “goal difference could be crucial” in determining the outcome of a pool also featuring fellow World Cup winners Italy – his players took heed. After a first half in which they unsurprisingly monopolised position but surprisingly scored just once, they hit six unanswered goals after the break. Diego Costa beat Alvaro Morata in the battle to spearhead Spain’s side, and after the former scored twice, the latter replaced him and did the same.\\nSome spellbinding step-overs from Marco Arnautovic facilitated Marc Janko putting Austria 2-0 up in Georgia. After the latter had then missed a sitter to extend the lead, a Jano Ananidze piledriver meant Marcel Koller’s men had to eke out a 2-1 win. Wales had no such worries as Moldova simply had no answer to Gareth Bale. The Real Madrid man set up the first with a devilish cross, sped away from the defence to dink home the third, and won and scored a penalty in a 4-0 win. The section’s other game was more dramatic. Jeff Hendrick’s deflected shot put Ireland ahead early on. Filip Kostic’s first drew Serbia level. The hosts then laid siege to the Irish goal and appeared to have got their reward when Dusan Tadic’s penalty edged them ahead. After they had hit the woodwork twice and Ireland had had a goal disallowed, however, Daryl Murphy’s maiden goal for his country snatched a 2-2 draw.\\nGroup I’s three games produced three 1-1 draws – ones Croatia and Ukraine will rue. Croatia beat Turkey 16-5 on shots and 9-1 on corners, but despite Ivan Rakitic giving them a 44th-minute lead, Turkey equalised immediately and that’s somehow how it finished, while Yevhen Konoplyanka missed a penalty late on in Kyiv to win it. Kosovo, meanwhile, gave a stellar account of themselves in their first competitive match, with Valon Berisha’s leveller from the spot securing a point.\\n*Player of the day *\\nVolkan Babacan was widely criticised for being beaten by Luka Modric’s volley in Turkey’s UEFA EURO 2016 curtain-raiser. Coach Fatih Terim rejected calls to drop the 28-year-old goalkeeper for the sides’ reunion, and he was repaid with a supreme performance in Zagreb. Babacan commanded his box with aplomb and made a series of fine saves, especially one which left Marko Pjaca gasping in disbelief.\\n*The number *\\n28 international goals have now been scored by David Silva, with his brace Leon elevating him above Emilio Butragueno and Fernando Morientes and into fifth on Spain’s list of all-time leading marksmen. Only David Villa (59), Raul (44), Fernando Torres (38) and Fernando Hierro (29) have netted more goals for La Roja.\\n*Did you know? *\\nJoe Allen’s goal was his first for Wales since debuting in 2009. Gareth Bale’s brace leapt him above Ivor Allchurch and Trevor Ford and into second of the Dragons’ list of all-time leadin scorers, four behind 28-goal Ian Rush.\\nWhat they said\\n“We certainly had the luck today. If Janko had made it 3-0, it would have been over. We didn’t find our rhythm, but we’ve managed to fulfil our duty. The victory was very important not only for our qualification hopes, but also for the atmosphere in the squad,\" Marcel Koller, *Austria coach*'},\n",

This one’s importance is indebted to their pool being arguably the most wide open, with little separating Croatia (15th), Turkey (19th), Iceland (23rd) and Ukraine (30th) on the FIFA Ranking, and Finland having put up a heroic showing in a section featuring Spain and France in Brazil 2014 qualifying. Ante Cacic has the likes of Modric, Ivan Rakitic, Mateo Kovacic and Ivan Perisic at his disposal. Fatih Terim, for his part, surprisingly overlooked Arda Turan and Burak Yilmaz as he selected a squad with a maximum age of 29. It includes 19-year-old forward Enes Unal, who recently hit a first-half hat-trick for Twente after joining on loan from Manchester City. Ukraine entertain Iceland in another intriguing *Group I duel, while Finland will expect three points from the visit of newcomers Kosovo.\\nThe other attractions *\\nAfter making it four World Cup appearances out of five at Germany 2006, Sweden have missed out on the last two. After dazzling at the last one, the Netherlands failed to even reach the recent EURO. Their new-look squads will both be out for victory given that they have France, who visit Belarus, for company in *Group A.\\nComing off the conquering of their maiden major trophy, Portugal visit Switzerland in a battle of the *Group B *favourites. Hungary, who are also hoping to have a say, can afford no slip-up in the Faroe Islands.\\nRetirements and injuries may have shorn Germany of several big names, but they still have an abundance of talent with the likes of Manuel Neuer, Toni Kroos, Mesut Ozil, Thomas Muller and Mario Gotze, while 20-year-old Max Meyer is threatening to become the latest. They head to Oslo, where opponents Norway troublingly lost 1-0 to Belarus on Wednesday. The World Cup holders’ chief rivals for top spot in Group C, Czech Republic and Northern Ireland, convene in Prague, while San Marino host Azerbaijan in the other game.\\nWales, fresh from a fine EURO and with Gareth Bale dazzling for Real Madrid, begin against Moldova in Cardiff. Austria, fresh from a forgettable showing in France, are in Georgia as Serbia entertain Republic of Ireland in a tussle of teams with genuine qualification aspirations in Group D.\\nA 0-0 loss in Armenia stymied Denmark’s chances of reaching EURO 2016, so now-coach Age Hareide has warned his charges against complacency as they entertain the same side. Poland and Romania will both have to do the same away to Kazakhstan and at home to Montenegro in Group E.\\nSam Allardyce’s first game as England manager is away to Slovakia, whom they drew with 0-0 at EURO 2016. Although a number of big-name players have struggled for their clubs this season, Wayne Rooney has provided a couple of assists and Raheem Sterling has looked rejuvenated under Pep Guardiola. Scotland will expect a successful Group F start in Malta.\\nSpain should win big in their Group G curtain-raiser at home to Liechtenstein, but chief rivals Italy have an examining start in Israel. New coach Giampiero Ventura surprisingly retained Graziano Pelle in his squad and handed a maiden call-up to exciting attacker Andrea Belotti. Albania, meanwhile, will be determined to pick up maximum points at home to FYR Macedonia as they strive to keep pace with the heavyweights.\\nRoberto Martinez is ready to unleash Kevin de Bruyne and Eden Hazard on Cyprus, to whom Belgium have never lost. Mehmed Bazdarevic has stressed his Bosnia and Herzegovina side cannot let the Belgians get away in Group H, and will be looking to Juventus midfielder Miralem Pjanic to ensure they don’t drop points at home to Estonia. Greece, too, know that if they are to make a third consecutive World Cup, they must be seeing off Gibraltar.\\n*Players to watch *\\nJoao Mario had an excellent EURO and since made a €40m move to Inter Milan. In the absence of Renato Sanches and Cristiano Ronaldo, added burden will be on the 23-year-old to create. Juventus full-back Stephan Lichtsteiner will be out to negate his threat 12 days before they clash in the Derby d’Italia.\\n*Did You Know? *\\nLum Rexhepi, who was born in Finland, won a senior cap for Finland and plays in Finland for HJK, is expected to line up against Finland for Kosovo.\\n*The quote\\nFernando Santos, Portugal coach: *“We’re the European champions.
