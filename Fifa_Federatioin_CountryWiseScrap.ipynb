       "   'content': \"Syria close in on early progression with fifth straight win\\nUzbekistan, Turkmenistan move top of their respective groups\\nQualifying action in Asia will resume in March\\nIt was a night of mixed results for the group leaders entering Tuesday's sixth matchday of Asia's second round qualifying for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar™. Syria opened up an eight-point gap in Group A with a fifth straight qualifying victory against Philippines to move closer to early progression to the next stage, while Qatar maintained their solitary-point lead with a 1-0 victory against Afghanistan.\\nIraq and Vietnam, however, failed to reinforce their position at the top of Groups C and G respectively, following draws against Thailand and Bahrain. Despite those results, they remain at the summit of their respective groups.\\nElsewhere, Uzbekistan bounced back to restore their place at the top of Group D following a 2-0 win over Palestine and fellow Central Asians Turkmenistan moved to the top of Group H with victory against Sri Lanka.\\nJoin FIFA.com as we take a closer look at the action across the continent.Matchday 6 results (19 November)\\nGroup A: Maldives 3-1 Guam, Syria 1-0 Philippines\\nGroup B: Nepal 0-1 Kuwait, Jordan 5-0 Chinese Taipei\\nGroup C: Hong Kong 2-0 Cambodia, Iraq 0-0 Bahrain\\nGroup D: Yemen 1-2 Singapore, Uzbekistan 2-0 Palestine\\nGroup E: Afghanistan 0-1 Qatar, Oman 1-0 India\\nGroup F: Myanmar 1-0 Mongolia, Kyrgyz Republic 1-1 Tajikistan\\nGroup G: Malaysia 2-0 Indonesia, Vietnam 0-0 Thailand\\nGroup H: Turkmenistan 2-0 Sri Lanka, Lebanon 0-0 Korea DPRThe match\\nMalaysia 2-0 Indonesia (Rasid 30', 73')\\nOn a day of few surprises, it was Malaysia's 2-0 home win against Indonesia in Group G which raised a number of eyebrows. Emerging star Safawi Rasid struck in each half as Tan Cheng Hoe's side followed up their 3-2 victory a few months ago in Jakarta by inflicting another blow on their close neighbours. In one of the region's top derbies, played in front of a fervent 80,000 capacity crowd at the Bukit Jalil Stadium, the visitors were the first to attack and came close to opening the scoring. Having weathered the early storm, however, the hosts took the lead on the half-hour mark courtesy of a Safawi free-kick.\\nThe second half saw both sides produce chances of their own but Malaysia had the final say when Safawi scored from an acute angle to seal the tie. The victory, coupled with the goalless draw between leaders Vietnam and Thailand in the other match, saw the Malayan Tigers move into second place, with a key match-up against United Arab Emirates looming in March.The other attractions\\nMidfielder Ward Salama scored the only goal as Group A leaders Syria stretched their outstanding run of consecutive victories to five with a 1-0 win against the Philippines in Dubai. The win saw Fajr Ibrahim's side open up an eight-point gap at the top, edging closer to an early spot in the next round. In the group's other match, efforts from Ali Samooh and Ali Ashfaq plus an own goal by Travis Nicklaw helped Maldives to a 3-1 victory against Guam at home, a result which moved them within a point of China PR and Philippines.\\nIn Group B, second-placed Kuwait and Jordan both won against their respective rivals to close the gap on leaders Australia. The Kuwaitis defeated hosts Nepal by 1-0 with captain Bader Al Motawaa striking the winner while the Jordanians fired five unanswered goals past visiting Chinese Taipei.\\nGroup C front-runners Iraq kept their two-point cushion intact despite being held to a goalless draw by second-placed Bahrain in Amman. Meanwhile, James Ha opened the scoring midway through the first half, before Roberto Junior struck the match-winner seven minutes from time as Hong Kong defeated ten-man Cambodia 2-0 at home to register their first win in the pool. The result saw Hong Kong trail IR Iran by just a point, making their meeting in March a mouthwatering prospect.\\nIn Group D, a 2-0 win against Palestine at home saw Uzbekistan return to pole position in the pool. In-form striker Eldor Shomurodov struck in each half as the Central Asians bounced back to winning form and leapfrogged Saudi Arabia to the top of the table. The group's other match saw Singapore edge Yemen 2-1 in Bahrain to move to third place.\\nThere were no changes in the top two of Group E, with leaders Qatar and second-placed Oman both prevailing. The Qataris did need a second-half penalty by Akram Afif to secure a solitary-goal victory against Afghanistan, who missed a spot-kick earlier in the first half. The Omanis, for their part, had Mohsin Al Ghassani to thank for scoring the only goal as they sealed a 1-0 win against India at home.\\nIn Group F, Tamirlan Kozubaev struck late to cancel out Jahongir Ergashev's early goal as hosts Kyrgyz Republic came from behind to draw 1-1 with Tajikistan. The result left the two teams still level on points, trailing leaders Japan by five points. In the other match, Myanmar continued their resurgence under new boss Antoine Hey, defeating Mongolia 1-0 at home to register their second consecutive win. Bo Bo Hlaing's first-half strike proved the difference as Myanmar avenged their first-leg loss with a hard-fought victory.\\nIn Group H, the matchday ended with Turkmenistan leapfrogging Korea Republic to the top of the standings. The Central Asians followed up their 3-1 victory against Korea DPR last time out by securing a 2-0 triumph against Sri Lanka courtesy of goals from Abdy Basimov and Altymyrat Annadurdyyew. The result, allied with Lebanon's goalless draw against Korea DPR, saw Ante Mise's side move a point clear at the top.Did you know?\\nThe compelling and difficult nature of this Asian qualifying campaign sees Asia's top-ranked sides - IR Iran and Korea Republic - sitting only third and second in their respective groups with the competition just past the halfway mark.\"},\n",

Notably, IR Iran and United Arab Emirates lost again to see their campaign in real danger while Korea Republic, Korea DPR and Thailand’s hopeful campaigns were dealt with a blow after dropping points.\\nMeanwhile, both Iraq and Saudi Arabia needed last-ditch efforts to win against IR Iran and Uzbekistan respectively but Japan, Syria and Australia maintained their unblemished records with a fourth-straight win to move closer to progression. Join FIFA.com as we take a closer look at the action across Asia.Matchday 5 results\\n14 November\\nGroup A: Maldives 1-2 Philippines, Syria 2-1 China PR\\nGroup B: Kuwait 9-0 Chinese Taipei, Jordan 0-1 Australia\\nGroup C: Hong Kong 0-0 Bahrain, Iraq 2-1 IR Iran\\nGroup D: Yemen 1-0 Palestine, Uzbekistan 2-3 Saudi Arabia\\nGroup E: Afghanistan 1-1 India, Oman 4-1 Bangladesh\\nGroup F: Myanmar 4-3 Tajikistan, Kyrgyz Republic 0-2 Japan\\nGroup G: Malaysia 2-1 Thailand, Vietnam 1-0 United Arab Emirates\\nGroup H: Turkmenistan 3-1 Korea DPR, Lebanon 0-0 Korea Republic\\nThe match\\nUzbekistan 2-3 Saudi Arabia\\nGoals: Eldor Shomurodov 16\\', Otabek Shukurov (pen) 56\\'; Salman Al Faraj (pen) 23\\', 85\\', Salem Al Dawsari 90\\'\\nIn Group D, captain Salman Al Faraj struck a brace as Saudi Arabia defeated hosts Uzbekistan 3-2 in dramatic fashion and leapfrogged their opponents to the top of the section. Indeed, Herve Renard\\'s visitors had to twice come from behind to draw themselves on level terms before sealing the three points through a dramatic last-minute effort.\\nIn what was the two sides\\' fifth World Cup qualifying meeting, Odil Ahmedov\\'s home side started brightly with Eldor Shomurodov opening the scoring with his fourth goal of this campaign. Their lead, however, proved short-lived as Al Faraj drew level minutes later through a spot-kick. Otabek Shukurov would restore the hosts\\' lead with a penalty after the restart, but Al Faraj struck the leveller five minutes from time before Salem Al Dawsari sealed the victory.\\nIn the other match, Omar Al Dahi scored the only goal as Yemen downed Palestine by a solitary goal to move into third place, trailing Uzbekistan by just a point.The other attractions\\nGroup A leaders Syria opened up a five-point cushion at the top of the section after defeating Marcello Lippi\\'s China PR 2-1 in Dubai. Osama Omari put the Syrians ahead but Wu Lei drew the Chinese level as the two sides finished the first half locked at 1-1. The balance was, however, tipped in Syria\\'s favour with defender Zhang Linpeng\\'s second-half own-goal gifting them a fortunate three points.\\nFollowing the match, Lippi announced his resignation as China manager: \"We won against minnows like Maldives and Guam but we drew against Philippines. And today Syria played better than us. I take the responsibility. I declare that I resign from the head coach\\'s post.\" \\nIn the group\\'s other match, the Philippines overcame hosts Maldives by the identical scoreline to move level with China on points.In Group B, Adam Taggart\\'s first-half goal proved the difference as Australia sank hosts Jordan 1-0. The victory saw Graham Arnold\\'s Socceroos cement their place at the top, now five points clear of the Jordanians. In the other match, Kuwait produced the matchday\\'s biggest win by thumping Chinese Taipei 9-0 at home to move level with Jordan on points and ahead of them on goal difference.\\nIn Group C, Asia\\'s top-ranked side IR Iran lost again, this time falling 2-1 to rivals Iraq in Amman. Mohanad Ali gave the Iraqis an early lead but the Iranians drew level midway through the first half through Ahmed Nourollahi. Srecko Katanec’s side had to leave it late when Alaa Abbas sealed the hard-fought win with an injury-time strike. The result, coupled with Bahrain\\'s goalless draw in Hong Kong, saw Iraq create a two-point gap on the Bahrainis while IR Iran, drifted four points from the summit with the their campaign in real jeopardy.\\nIn Group E, a 4-1 win over Bangladesh saw hosts Oman move within a point of leaders Qatar who were not in action. In the other match, Seimeinlen Doungel cancelled out Zelfy Nazary\\'s first-half goal with a last-minute strike as India shared the spoils with Afghanistan in a 1-1 stalemate, a result which saw the two sides\\' hopes further fade away.In Group F, a 2-0 win in Kyrgyz Republic saw Japan extend their lead at the top to six points and move to within touching distance of sealing the section\\'s sole automatic qualifying spot. Takumi Minamino and Genki Haraguchi struck in each half as Hajime Moriyasu\\'s Samurai Blue maintained their perfect record this campaign. Bottom side Myanmar, meanwhile, registered their first points by edging Tajikistan 4-3 at home.\\nIn Group G, Vietnam moved into the section\\'s summit following a shock 1-0 victory over the United Arab Emirates at home. Nguyen Tien Linh scored the only goal as the hosts maintained their undefeated record in this campaign. In the other match, Brendan Gan cancelled out Chanathip Songkrasin\\'s early goal before Mohamadou Sumareh struck the match-winner as Malaysia edged Thailand 2-1 to register a crucial win.\\nIn Group H, both Korea Republic and Korea DPR disappointed by dropping points. The former were held to a goalless draw by hosts Lebanon, while the latter floundered 3-1 in Turkmenistan. Despite the draw, Paulo Bento\\'s visitors remain at the top of the section one point clear of Lebanon and Korea DPR. Turkmenistan, with two victories, are a point further down. With the top four teams separated by just two points, the race for the group\\'s sole qualifying berth remains wide open.\\nDid you know?\\nWhile Australia’s 1-0 win against Jordan was their first away victory in Amman, Myanmar also made a piece of their own history by grabbing their first-ever triumph against Tajikistan.'},\n",

Join FIFA.com as we preview these match-ups across Asia.\\nMatchday 4 fixtures\\n(15 October)\\nGroup A: Philippines-China PR, Syria-Guam\\nGroup B: Chinese Taipei-Australia, Jordan-Nepal\\nGroup C: Bahrain-IR Iran, Cambodia-Iraq\\nGroup D: Palestine-Saudi Arabia, Singapore-Uzbekistan\\nGroup E: India-Bangladesh, Qatar-Oman\\nGroup F: Tajikistan-Japan, Mongolia-Kyrgyz Republic\\nGroup G: Thailand-United Arab Emirates, Indonesia-Vietnam\\nGroup H: Korea DPR-Korea Republic, Sri Lanka-Lebanon\\nThe match\\nKorea DPR-Korea Republic\\nSharing top spot in Group H with six points each, these two teams enter the showdown in Pyongyang knowing that the victor will move clear at the summit of the table. With only the group winners advancing to the next stage, it is a match which neither side can afford to lose.\\nIn a sense, Paulo Bento's visitors boast a slight mental edge, having remained undefeated in the pair’s past six World Cup qualifying meetings with three wins and three draws. Yun Jongsu's hosts can, however, look to their trademark resilient play which has seen them frustrate opponents time and again.\\nEven the match itself is special - it marks the first time that Korea DPR have hosted Korea Republic on home soil in nearly three decades. Ten years back, the Chollima twice held their southern neighbours in neutral Shanghai in their 'home games' en route to successful qualification for South Africa 2010. Sri Lanka host Lebanon in the other group match.The other attractions\\nIn Group A, Marcello Lippi's China travel to the Philippines seeking their third straight win. Team Dragon will look to the goalscoring form of Espanyol forward Wu Lei who scored a brace in their 3-0 drubbing of the Azkals in January's 2019 AFC Asian Cup. In the other match, Syria entertain Guam knowing that there is no room for slip-ups if they are to keep pressure on the Chinese before the two sides’ crunch tie in Dubai next month.\\nGroup B front-runners Australia travel to Chinese Taipei aiming to strengthen their grip on the section with a third consecutive victory. Furthermore, this match provides another opportunity for coach Graham Arnold to test new young players and formations. Second-place Jordan, meanwhile, entertain Nepal in the section's other game seeking to bounce back, having being held to a disappointing goalless draw by Kuwait.\\nIn Group C, Marc Wilmots' free-scoring IR Iran will likely have their first real test against hosts Bahrain who famously inflicted a 3-1 defeat on Team Melli on the road to Korea/Japan 2002. Any slip-ups by IR Iran will benefit Iraq, who can move to the top of the table with a win in Cambodia.\\nGroup D's Palestine will be hoping to reproduce the form which saw them stun Uzbekistan 2-0 in the opener when they entertain Saudi Arabia. In fact, the hosts did catch the Green Falcons by surprise by holding them to a goalless draw at home four years ago during Russia 2018 qualifying. In the other match, Uzbekistan face a must-win against hosts Singapore if they are to keep their campaign on track.\\nGroup E leaders Qatar welcome Oman seeking to prolong their undefeated head-to-head record, having managed two wins and two draws in the past four World Cup qualifying meetings. In the other match, India host pointless Bangladesh in Kolkata’s mighty Salt Lake stadium with each side desperately seeking to rekindle hopes with a first win.\\nIn Group F, joint leaders Tajikistan and Japan do battle with both seeking to move clear with victory. The visiting Samurai Blue smashed 12 unanswered goals past Tajikistan over two legs on the road to Brazil 2014. Mongolia, meanwhile, will look to their ever-growing home support in this campaign as they aim to spring another surprise against visiting Kyrgyz Republic.\\nGroup G pace-setters United Arab Emirates know they will face a tough test in Thailand after the pair played out a tense 1-1 draw in their last meeting during the Asian Cup. In the other match, pointless Indonesia entertain Vietnam desperately needing a win to keep their hopes alive.\\nDid you know?\\nIndia’s meeting with neighbours Bangladesh is the pair’s third FIFA World Cup qualifier and 29th match in all competitions since 1978. The Indians have emerged the dominant side so far with 15 wins and just two defeats.\"},\n",

Playing the home game in neutral Dubai, the Syrians went into the match as the clear favourites considering that they are 68 places above the visitors in the FIFA/Coca-Cola Men’s World Ranking. The opponents had, however, proved capable of upsets in the qualifying campaign in the past, notably holding Korea Republic to a goalless draw on the road to Germany 2006.\\nSyria dominated the proceedings with captain Omar Al Soma striking in each half to give them a 2-0 lead inside 60 minutes. With the hosts looking on course to victory, however, they were reduced to ten men with defender Ahmed Al Salih seeing a red card. Capitalising on the numerical advantage, the Maldives quickly pulled one back through Ali Ashfaq. However, an equaliser didn't come, with the Syrians striving to keep the rivals at bay and run their one-goal lead to victory.\\nIn the group’s other game, in-form forward Yang Xu scored four times as Marcello Lippi's China cruised past Guam 7-0 at home. The results now see Syria and China level on points with the Chinese on top courtesy of their superior goal difference.\\nThe other attractions\\nIn Group B, hosts Australia put five unanswered goals past Nepal at home for their second successive win. Striker Jamie Maclaren completed a hat-trick and young defender Harry Souttar struck in his international debut as Graham Arnold's Socceroos stayed perfect in this campaign. The result, coupled with Jordan’s goalless draw with Kuwait in the other match, saw Australia move clear with a two-point cushion at the top.\\nIR Iran moved clear at the top of Group C after thumping Cambodia 14-0 at home. Indeed, Marc Wilmots' side showed the visitors no mercy. Star striker Karim Ansarifard scored four times and Sardar Azmoun completed a hat-trick as they produced the matchday's biggest win. In the other match, Iraq registered their first win by defeating visiting Hong Kong 2-0 to move to second place level with Bahrain on points.\\nIn Group D, both Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan bounced back to win at home respectively as they put their campaigns back on track. The former beat Singapore 3-0 to move to the top of the section and the latter swept past Yemen 5-0 to register their first win under new boss Vadim Abramov.\\nGroup E front-runners Qatar cemented their place at the top by overcoming hosts Bangladesh 2-0. Forwards Yusuf Abdurisag and Karim Boudiaf scored in each half as the visitors got past the resilient home side. Oman, meanwhile, defeated Afghanistan 3-0 at home to maintain pressure on the Qataris, trailing by merely a point.\\nGroup F favourites Japan followed up their 2-0 opening win over Myanmar with a 6-0 resounding victory against Mongolia at home. Goals from six different players, including Daichi Kamada, gave Hajime Moriyasu's side a second consecutive win. The result moved the Samurai Blue to the top of the table level with Tajikistan on points. In the section’s other match, Edgar Bernhardt scored a hat-trick as Kyrgyz Republic hammered Myanmar 7-0 at home for their first win in this campaign, and significantly, their biggest ever victory in international competition.\\nIn Group G, United Arab Emirates leapfrogged Thailand to the top of the table by defeating Indonesia 5-0 at home, with ace striker Ali Mabkhout completing a hat-trick. In the other match, Nguyen Quang Hai struck the only goal as Vietnam defeated Malaysia 1-0 at home for their first win in this campaign.\\nIn Group H, towering forward Kim Shinwook struck four times and captain Son Heungmin completed a brace as Korea Republic ran out 8-0 victors against Sri Lanka. The win moved the Taeguk Warriors level with Korea DPR on points at the top, making the two sides’ crunch tie in five days a mouthwatering one. The group’s other match saw Lebanon clinch their first win, defeating Turkmenistan 2-1.\\nDid you know?\\nWhile IR Iran's 14-0 victory stood out as the biggest of the matchday, the double-digit scoreline paled in comparison to their 19-0 victory against Guam in a qualifier for Korea/Japan 2002, which remains as Team Melli's all-time biggest win.\"},\n",

And their head-to-head record adds further weight to Qatar’s favourtism with the 2022 FIFA World Cup™ hosts boasting two wins and a draw in their past three meetings, all in AFC Asian Cup qualifying. Yet Felix Sanchez's charges received a wake-up call in their last outing when they could only manage a goalless draw against India at home, with their campaign doubling as Asian Cup qualifying.\\nDespite losing to Afghanistan by a solitary-goal in the opener, Jamie Day's Bangladesh are keen to prove themselves in front of their home supporters. Of course, few question Qatar's status as the undisputed favourites after their spectacular form that secured a maiden Asian Cup in January.\\nThe section's other match pits Oman against Afghanistan, both currently locked in second on three points and aiming to move clear with victory.The other attractions\\nIn Group A, Marcello Lippi's China PR welcome Guam seeking a second win but they will be wary of Karl Dodd's visitors, who pulled off stunning victories against the likes of India and Turkmenistan on the road to Russia 2018. In the group's other match, Syria entertain Maldives in Dubai hoping to continue their winning form.\\nGroup B's Australia welcome Nepal confident of building on their proud home record - the Socceroos' only home defeat since 1981 was a 1-0 reversal against China in 2008 when their qualifying mission had already been completed. Jordan, meanwhile, entertain Kuwait hoping that they can manage a better result than the 1-1 draw in the two sides' WAFF Championship meeting a couple of months ago.\\nIn Group C, a second win is firmly in IR Iran's grasp when they host Cambodia, despite missing star attacker Alireza Jahanbakhsh. Coach Marc Wilmots does not lack for firepower with ace-strikers Sardar Azmoun and Mehdi Taremi at his disposal. Iraq welcome Hong Kong in the group's other match with the hosts determined to bounce back with a victory having drawn 1-1 against Bahrain in the opener.\\nIn Group D, both Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan enter the matchday hoping to put their campaign back on track with victories against Singapore and Yemen respectively. The West Asians can take heart from their undefeated record while the Central Asians, under returning boss Vadim Abramov, will be confident of prolonging their superior record having won all four past World Cup qualifying meetings against the Yemenis.\\nIn Group F, coach Hajime Moriyasu has named a full-strength Japan squad largely consisting of their European-based stars as they aim to secure a second successive win against Mongolia at home. The other match sees hosts Kyrgyz Republic and Myanmar seeking to grab their first points.\\nGroup G bottom side Indonesia travels to United Arab Emirates desperately seeking to stay in touch with the rest of the group after suffering back-to-back losses at home. However, Bert van Marwijk's side boast strong home form, including three wins and a draw in local conditions during their Russia 2018 campaign. A pair of old foes re-unite in the other match with hosts Vietnam and Malaysia hoping to get back on track with victory.\\nElsewhere, Group H favourites Korea Republic host Sri Lanka with their sights fixed firmly on three points while pointless Lebanon entertain Turkmenistan keen to rekindle their hopes with a win at home.\\nDid you know?\\nIraq fans will end their long wait for a game on home soil when they will finally host a World Cup qualifier as they welcome Hong Kong to the Basra International Stadium.

In the section's other match, Goran Milojevic's Philippines put their opening 5-2 loss to Syria behind them by defeating hosts Guam 4-1.

Davron Ergashev headed home the match-winner nine minutes from time as the Central Asians consolidate their place at the top. The section's other match saw Japan get their campaign off to a perfect start by winning 2-0 in Myanmar.

       "   'content': \"Iran face stern tests in Iraq and Bahrain\\nSouth-east quartet grouped together\\nAustralia resume rivalry with Jordan\\nAsia's top forty teams have learned the hurdles they must overcome on the road to the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ after the draw for the second qualifying round took place in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on Wednesday.\\nDivided into eight groups of five, these sides will battle it out against each other across ten months from 5 September 2019 to 9 June 2020, with the eight section winners and four best runners-up advancing. Should Qatar win their group, the other seven group winners and five best runners-up who progress to the next stage.\\nConducted by FIFA Director of Competitions Christian Unger and Australian FIFA Legend Tim Cahill, the draw did provide some enticing pairings which see familiar foes reunite. Meanwhile, there are emerging sides who enter this campaign seeking to mount serious challenges to the traditional powerhouses. Join FIFA.com as we take a closer look at the groups.Groups overview\\nGroup A: China PR, Syria, Philippines, Maldives, Guam\\nGroup B: Australia, Jordan, Chinese Taipei, Kuwait, Nepal\\nGroup C: Iran, Iraq, Bahrain, Hong Kong, Cambodia\\nGroup D: Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, Palestine, Yemen, Singapore\\nGroup E: Qatar, Oman, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh\\nGroup F: Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Myanmar, Mongolia\\nGroup G: United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia\\nGroup H: Korea Republic, Lebanon, Korea DPR, Turkmenistan, Sri Lanka\\nHeadline-grabbers\\nGroup G is definitely an interesting one to watch with four South-east Asia teams crossing paths in what looks a regional competition. Joining the quartet is the group's top seed, United Arab Emirates, who aim to seal their World Cup return. While the Italy 1990 participants are the highly-favoured side, they cannot underestimate their competition. Both Thailand and Vietnam pose a threat considering their impressive displays in this year's AFC Asian Cup, while Indonesia and Malaysia can spring a surprise or two.\\nThere will likely be a three-way battle in Group C, with Asia's top-ranked side Iran pitted against a pair of nemeses in Iraq and Bahrain. Team Melli may enter the campaign as the team to beat, but both rivals have historically proved capable of causing them headaches. Iraq scored a 2-1 victory against Iran on the road to USA 1994, while Bahrain can take heart from their famous 3-1 stunner in 2002 World Cup qualifying.The other attractions\\nAsia's most successful side on the qualifying scene, Group H top seed Korea Republic, enter the competition with their sights fixed firmly on their tenth World Cup appearance. While a place in the next round appears within their grasp, Paulo Bento's Taegeuk Warriors will need to be wary of the resilient Korea DPR and Lebanon.\\nGroup B will see Australia and Jordan resume their fast-developing rivalry, having played against each other in four World Cup qualifying matches for the past two World Cups. Each side has two victories from those encounters, but Jordan's recent 1-0 Asian Cup win provides them with a boost.\\nChina PR and Syria are likely to dominate the proceedings in Group A, which also features the Philippines, Maldives and Guam. Marcello Lippi's new-look Team Dragon will enter the group determined to seal the top spot.\\nIn Group D, Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan cross swords in what will be their fifth World Cup qualifying encounter. While the two sides are favourites to finish at the top, Palestine have proved hard to crack, while both Yemen and Singapore can impress when they are on top of their game.\\nWith reigning Asian champions and the 2022 World Cup hosts Qatar the undisputed favourites to win Group E, Oman and India will likely be left vying for the second spot and a potential qualifying position.\\nIt looks a kind draw for Japan alongside the likes of Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Myanmar and debutants Mongolia. The only question mark may be which side can take the second qualifying spot.\\nDid you know?\\nTwo years, five months and 24 days is the length of time required to decide Asia's qualified teams for Qatar 2022, with the massive campaign running from 6 June 2019 till 16 November 2021.\"},\n",

In order to do so, FIFA has worked with reputable entities, such as United Nations agencies, with which we have formed a strong working relationship on human rights issues in recent years.\\n\"The former president of the Afghanistan Football Federation was eventually banned for life and fined CHF 1 million by the independent Ethics Committee, which is the strongest sanction that can be imposed under the FIFA Code of Ethics. Furthermore, FIFA is carefully looking into allegations levelled against additional persons, and will not hesitate to take appropriate measures and impose sanctions if justified, just as it has done in the case of the president of the association.\\n\"FIFA has also taken a leading role in supporting those players who were forced to leave Afghanistan to gain asylum in safe environments and out of immediate danger. We continue to stay in close contact with them and support them in rebuilding their lives and recovering from the abhorrent ordeal they have suffered. The coach of the national team, Kelly Lindsey, is well aware of these efforts and the support that FIFA has provided, and we are therefore surprised and disappointed by her criticism, which we consider to be both ill-informed and unjustified.\\n\"We would like to reiterate that FIFA has a zero-tolerance policy on human-rights violations and unequivocally condemns all forms of gender-based violence.”'},\n",

There has to be a winner and a loser, right?\\nFor Mika Sayfurahman (wearing No13 pictured above), who turns 15 today, she has a perspective that even some adults lack. Don’t get it wrong, she wants to win every game she plays, but playing for the Afghanistan women’s national team has provided a wider view on the world and given her a great purpose.\\n“My goal is to inspire young girls to start playing soccer,” Sayfurahman told FIFA.com. “That’s my main goal.”\\nMika is one of several examples of players that represent a new dawn and a hope for Afghan women wanting to make it as professional footballers.\\nShe picked up the game as a four-year-old, passing the ball around with her father at her brothers’ soccer practices in California, where she grew up most of her life.\\nIt was there in California where she was discovered by Afghanistan women’s national team assistant coach Haley Carter, at a tournament hosted by the close-knit Afghan community in the Bay Area. Just a few months later, she was on a plane to India on her way to represent Afghanistan at the South Asian Football Federation Championship.\\n“Mika stood out right away,” Carter told FIFA.com. “She’s a little bitty thing, but she’s fierce. She’s got a great attitude, she works really hard, she’s really coachable, she’s hilarious and has a great sense of humour. She’s a really good source of energy to have around.\\n“She’s actually one of the more mature players from a soccer IQ and professionalism stand-point. She’s serious about the game and passionate about her development.”\\nSayfurahman embodies everything Afghanistan head coach Kelly Lindsey and her staff wants: skill, high technical ability, fitness, ability to play a physical game, ability to read the game, professionalism and passion for the game. “She’s young, but she set’s the example,” Carter said.Sayfurahman and the Afghanistan women’s national team, originally formed in 2007, recently played Jordan, hosts of the upcoming 2018 AFC Women’s Asian Cup and a top-50 side, in a pair of friendlies in which they were on the end of two lopsided scorelines (5-0 and 6-0).\\nBut don’t let the results take away from the bigger picture. In football, there’s always a story behind the headline, and in this case, Afghanistan learned a great deal from the experience.\\n“We didn’t just sit back and play defence,” Carter said. “We told the girls, ‘Go out and play.' You can sit and park the bus, but this isn’t a major tournament and it doesn’t do you any good to do that. That’s not how you’re going to get better.\\n“To go and compete against a team that’s ranked 50th, who I am confident will qualify for the World Cup, and come out with that scoreline is massive. It’s huge.”\\nFor Carter, there are two tangible objectives for the future: moving up the FIFA/Coca-Cola Women’s World Ranking and participating in the preliminary round for the next AFC Women’s Asian Cup cycle.\\n“We need to see a quantifiable jump in the FIFA Ranking in that it will help us drive fundraising efforts,” Carter said. “When we can quantify the progress that’s being made, that’s going to go a really long way.”\\nWhat gives Carter and Sayfurahman hope about the team in the next few years?\\n“The youth of this team and the interest and their passion to drive this programme forward, be a part of it and make the investment, is huge,” Carter said. “Secondly, the unity we have. We tell them, ‘You’re all Afghan. We’re all one team. We’re all fighting for the same things.’ We’re getting to a place now that players are reaching out to us because they want to participate.”\\nThe players on the team take accountability and responsibility seriously and have created a leadership council and give the staff feedback. Momentum is building in many ways.\\n“We all treat each other like sisters,” Sayfurahman said. “We’re all really close to each other. I really love all of them. I think the future’s bright. We have a lot of talent.”\"},\n",

Mohammad Hossein Mirshamsi’s side started their campaign with a 14-0 thumping of tournament hosts Malaysia before earning results against Afghanistan (6-1), China PR (10-0) and Bahrain (5-2).

Thailand, 0 pts\\n*The last-minute withdrawal of Uzbekistan from Malaysia 2017 put the onus on the remaining three teams in Group B to try and win both of their group matches in order to advance to the last four. After both sides claimed victories over Thailand, Oman and Lebanon squared off in the group decider. In a dramatic contest, the Lebanese ended Oman’s reign as Asian champions with a 4-3 victory.

The Emiratis opened their account with a 6-0 win over Iraq before easing past Qatar 8-1. The Japanese were even more prolific in front of goal, thrashing the Qataris 14-0 and the Iraqis 11-2. That set up a group decider between UAE and Japan, and it was the Middle Eastern nation that triumphed 5-4 to win Group C and advance to the semi-finals.

Mokhtari, Hassan Abdollahi and Mohammad Ahmadzadeh each scored twice for the Iranians, as they advanced to Saturday’s final and claimed their country’s seventh berth at a Beach Soccer World Cup.\\nThe final day of action on 11 March saw the two losing semi-finalists in Lebanon and Japan contest the final qualifying berth for the Bahamas in the match for third place.

       "   'content': 'There was nothing unusual about the way Khalida Popal started out playing football – it all began with a ball. Yet what is remarkable is that she did so in her homeland Afghanistan, a country where it used to be unthinkable for women to participate in sports, especially those that take place in public.\\n\"I remember the day my mother brought me football boots,\" she told FIFA.com in an exclusive interview. \"We had a very old football at our school, but didn\\'t have any other activities after school. So we would kick the ball around and have fun, but one day we had trouble with some men, who said, \\'Football isn\\'t for women. It’s an insult for the game if women play.\\' That made us stand up for our right to play, stand up for women’s rights and for gender equality.\"\\nSuch comments highlight that the game was far more than just a pastime for Popal; it became a way for her to fight for women\\'s rights in her homeland and to bring about a change in society. It was certainly no easy task for the 28-year-old, who made history in 2007 by becoming the first captain of the Afghanistan women\\'s national team. She encountered extreme opposition, with her brother and coach both beaten in order to force her to quit. Fearing for her life, she eventually fled Afghanistan alone in April 2011. She escaped to India and applied for asylum to Denmark, where she still lives.* *\"When I became the head of the women’s football committee my voice was very strong,\" Popal said, outlining why she left Afghanistan. \"I was really enjoying the time and the victory of football becoming more widely known in Afghanistan. We talked and played openly there. That was when I thought, \\'We\\'re winning\\'. But suddenly everything changed when my voice grew and the message got very strong.\\n\"I didn\\'t know that my voice would pose a threat to my life as a leader who wanted to empower women in the country through sports, and to encourage them to join the movement. I faced death threats and had to choose to leave my country. It was a really difficult decision. But I never give up on my dreams, my objective and my fight for women because it\\'s very important. That’s why I\\'m still involved in women’s football.\"* *\\n*Paving the way *Not only has the former defender blazed a trail for the next generation to follow, she has also helped increase the importance of the women\\'s game. \"When I started playing in 2004 there were only a few girls, maybe eight to ten, playing football for the first time in the history of the country,\" Popal said. \"Now there are more than two or three thousand women playing in Afghanistan - not only in the capital city but in the surrounding area too.\" She also revealed that several events are planned in Afghanistan in honour of International Women\\'s Day, although she will be unable to attend them personally.\\n\"I love my country and I love working in my country. But as long as the situation doesn\\'t change, I\\'ll keep working for women’s football in Afghanistan. I\\'m the programme director of the national team. I coordinate the programmes and organise different events in the country from abroad. That keeps me alive and happy. Even if I\\'m far away from my country, I\\'m still connected to it.\"\\nPopal has already spoken at the United Nations and at diverse human rights conferences across the globe about her fight for women\\'s rights. She was also among the guest speakers at the FIFA Conference for Equality and Inclusion, which took place at the Home of FIFA on Monday.\\n\"Being at this event at this conference is a great opportunity for me,\" said the Kabul native. \"It\\'s a great platform to send out the message to the authorities, to the people who are the decision makers, to the people who make decisions about improving women\\'s football, the people who empower women in order to increase gender equality. I\\'m very happy and it was a great opportunity that I could talk directly to the FIFA President and that he was there to hear.\"\\nPerhaps her commitment to the cause will soon be rewarded, and her deepest ambition could become a reality. \"It\\'s my dream,\" she explained, \"to see the Afghanistan women’s national team play at a World Cup.\"'},\n",

The Sultanate have been drawn in Group B, where they will face Lebanon and Thailand in a revised three-team group following the last-minute withdrawal of Uzbekistan from the qualifiers.\\nTalib Hilal Al Thanawi’s side have also had a good build-up to Malaysia 2017, having defeated European powerhouse Switzerland in two recent friendlies in the Omani capital of Muscat before earning wins over Bahrain last month.\\nUzbekistan’s late withdrawal will make the task of reaching the semi-finals from Group B more challenging, as the successful side will likely need two victories to win the group and advance to the last four.\\nLooking for a third Asian crown\\nGroup C consists of two sides looking to become the competition’s most successful team in Japan and United Arab Emirates. The Japanese were Asian champions in 2009 and 2011, while UAE claimed the title in 2007 and 2008.\\nMarcelo Mendes’s Japanese squad will also have the extra motivation of trying to go one better than two years ago when they lost on penalties to Oman in the final. Their preparations included success at last month’s Thailand 5s Beach Soccer Championship, where the Far East nation scored an impressive 32 goals in four matches in Bangkok.\\nQatar, who hosted the last two editions of the AFC Beach Soccer Championship, and Iraq round out the field in the four-team Group C.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'When Murtaza Ahmady stepped off the plane at Hamad International Airport following his journey from Afghanistan, the six-year-old boy asked his father Mohammed a single question: ‘Where is the house of Messi?’\\nThe football-crazy youngster had made the special journey to Qatar to meet his FC Barcelona hero. Images of him wearing a plastic bag of Argentinian national colours with Messi written on the back had gone viral on social media earlier this year. Subsequently, the ‘Albiceleste’ (white and sky blue) superstar had sent young Murtaza a signed jersey and football, and promised to meet him in person when the chance arose. \\nThe Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) was inspired by the story of the small boy and his dream, and decided to try and find him to give him the chance of meeting his hero.\\nOn 13 December, that day arrived. Murtaza finally got the chance to hold his hero’s hand and got a giant hug from Messi on the morning of the ‘Match of Champions’ game between Barcelona and Al Ahli on Tuesday. As the Barcelona players walked past him on the way to a meeting room at the team hotel, Murtaza spotted Messi and reached out a hand, which the Argentina superstar held with a big smile. \\nA few moments later, Murtaza received a large embrace from his hero, who held him in his arms as the Barcelona team gathered behind him.Speaking with sc.qa, Murtaza said after his meeting with Messi: “I’m very happy to have met my hero. It is a dream for me. I can’t wait to see Messi at the game, it will be the first time for me in the stadium.”\\nOn Tuesday evening, Murtaza was selected as one of the player escorts to walk out onto the pitch with his idol, providing another memory of a lifetime for him on his trip to Doha. \\nAn SC spokesperson said: “It was inspirational to meet Murtaza, and see him fulfil his dream. We were all kids once and had dreams, and in Qatar many of us still have them. \\n“Murtaza’s dream was to meet his hero. We are in a fortunate position here that we were able to bring them together. It’s about a kid and his dream. That’s it. That pretty much sums up the power of football.\\n\"We were struck by his story from the beginning, and are delighted that we made the meeting happen. The story is symbolic of our belief that football can change lives for the better, and inspire youngsters from across our region and beyond.\"'},\n",

       "   'content': 'For several nations, Asia’s second stage of qualifying for the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ will be remembered as a watershed campaign. Hitherto unscaled heights were conquered by a number of countries whose international achievement had previously been modest.\\nThailand’s War Elephants reflected the nation’s recent success in the AFC Champions League by reaching the final stage in style after finishing top of their group. Syria, meanwhile, defied all expectations given the nation’s high-profile domestic troubles, to also advance with six wins from eight outings.\\nAt the other end of the scale, *FIFA.com *takes a look at some of the nations whose campaign may be over but, thanks to some history-making achievements, is far from forgotten.\\nAfghanistan\\nAfghanistan are on a clear upward trajectory, despite spending the best part of two decades in the international wilderness due to the political turmoil in their homeland. Since returning to the international sphere in 2002 their progress has been impressive, but never more so than in recent times. Their three previous FIFA World Cups campaigns have failed to yield a single win, yet the current crop achieved three victories this time around, capped by a notable triumph this week over four-time southeast Asia champions Singapore. This, despite being forced to play their home matches in Iran, although thousands of Afghani diaspora were on hand this week to witness the team’s best World Cup win to date. The 2013 South Asian champions - and 2015 runners-up - now have a realistic chance of qualification for a maiden AFC Asian Cup after winning through to the qualifying stage.\\n*Guam *\\nIt is hard to imagine a nation of just 170,000 citizens overcoming one of over one billion, but that is exactly what Guam achieved last year when they defeated India during Russia 2018 qualifying. Yet 15 years earlier, they suffered a then record 19-0 World Cup defeat. The contrast is somewhat of a metaphor for the team’s development, both technically and mentally, during the tenure of English coach Gary White. Under White, the team have embraced their indigenous Chamorro culture. Now known as the Matao, the remote north Pacific nation have reached unimaginable heights in relative terms. That victory over India last June, was preceded a few days earlier with a win over Turkmenistan in the nation’s long-awaited home World Cup qualifier. Incredibly Guam, discounting their two games against Iran, conceded just three goals in six matches, finishing fourth in the group.\\n*Hong Kong *\\nThe history of football in Hong Kong incorporates not just the foundation years of the Asian Football Confederation during the 1950s, but back almost to the turn of the last century. The territory off the coast of China PR was a force in Asian football many decades ago, and now the wheel is starting to turn once again. Hong Kong’s most famous World Cup result remains a barely imaginable 2-1 win over China in 1985, but two draws against the same opponent during the current campaign left the world’s biggest nation sweating for a result on the final matchday. Hong Kong ultimately finished third, just three points off qualification. Under wily Korea Republic coach Kim Pan-Gon, the national team are finding success reflective of the work done at grassroots levels over recent years by the Hong Kong Football Association.\\n*Palestine *\\nFresh from featuring in their maiden Asian Cup at the commencement of 2015, Palestine continued to demonstrate their capabilities throughout Russia 2018 qualifiers. Finishing third in their group, Palestine’s results were extraordinary in the circumstances. They held United Arab Emirates - boasting arguably the continent’s best attack - to a scoreless draw, and proved it was no fluke by reprising that scoreline against reinvigorated west Asian aristocrats Saudi Arabia, with the latter result achieved in neutral Jordan. Three wins from their eight matches is comfortably a new high. Technically gifted and physically powerful, Palestine now have in place the building blocks for further success.\\n*Philippines *\\nLong regarded one of southeast Asia’s weaker football nations, Philippines have well and truly shrugged off that tag in recent years. Firstly under German mentor Michael Weiss, and more recently under former USA captain Thomas Dooley, the Azkals are now capable of providing stiff opposition to any team on the continent. That new found resolve was in evidence on Tuesday as the Philippines completed an eleventh-hour 3-2 comeback win over 2010 World Cup participants Korea DPR, a team normally renowned for their defensive steadfastness. The result was doubly significant given victory for Korea DPR would have been enough for the *Chollima *to stay in the race for Russia 2018, at the expense of neighbours China.\\nHistorically, Philippines have rarely participated in World Cup qualifying, and remarkably they didn’t feature as recently as the campaign for South Africa 2010. But their new-look team, which includes numerous players with overseas experience, won three of their eight matches, dramatically improving on a previous record of one win from 13 previous outings.'},\n",

       "   'content': \"It has taken nine months, and some 150 matches featuring 39 nations, but 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ qualifying in Asia is finally on the cusp of concluding its second stage. The globe’s largest continent will see its Russia 2018 campaign whittled down to 12 teams on Tuesday. From there, four sides will book progression to Russia, while a fifth will enter into an intercontinental play-off against a CONCACAF opponent.\\nFor now, though, all the focus is on Tuesday. Five teams are already through to September’s third stage – Qatar, Korea Republic, Japan, Saudi Arabia and Thailand – leaving seven spots to be filled on what promises to be a compelling denouement to stage two. The top teams in each of the eight groups will progress, alongside the four best second-placed teams. There are also tickets to AFC Asian Cup qualifying up for grabs. FIFA.compreviews all the action.\\nThe match\\n*Australia-Jordan\\n*It is winner-takes-all in Sydney in a near-repeat of a scenario from four years ago. On that occasion Australia overpowered Jordan with a crucial 4-0 win to end the latter’s Brazil 2014 hopes. As was the case during that campaign, Jordan notched a win over the Socceroos in Amman. Now Jordan head Down Under needing to reprise last October’s 2-0 victory if they are to leapfrog their rivals into top spot in Group B and guarantee progress. Former English Premier League manager Harry Redknapp will be making his second appearance in the Jordanian dugout, though his task is a challenging one with the Socceroos protecting a strong home record, and needing just a point. Both Australia and Jordan enter the match in goalscoring form have netted seven and eight goals respectively on Thursday. Fourth-placed Tajikistan will host third-placed Kyrgyzstan with only pride on the line.\\nThe other attractions *A fascinating contest is in prospect in Abu Dhabi where United Arab Emirates need to beat a rejuvenated Saudi Arabia by two goals to finish top of *Group A. UAE’s much vaunted attack was relatively quiet in a 2-0 win over Palestine on Thursday, and a failure to fire here may leave the Asian Cup bronze medal winners facing a contest to be one of the best runner-ups. The other match sees Palestine host Timor-Leste as two teams from opposite corners of the sprawling continent do battle.\\nMuch focus will be on Group C where China PR need a win at home against the already-qualified Qatar, or face the very real prospect of yet another early elimination from World Cup qualifying. It promises to be a nervous night for the Chinese against a side with momentum and form on their side. While the world’s most populous nation have stumbled through qualifying, leaders Qatar have remained perfect. Elsewhere, Ricki Herbert’s Maldives, who will be without the services of goalscoring ace Ali Ashfaq, will seek to end their campaign on a high in Male against modest Bhutan.\\nThree points clear and with a 15-goal advantage, Group D leaders Iran welcome second-placed Oman with what is effectively an unassailable advantage. Oman have second sewn up, but like many other second-placed teams, they are in a desperate scramble to accrue as many points as possible. The other group match will see India complete a disappointing campaign by welcoming Turkmenistan.\\nMeanwhile over in Group E, Syria are in a very similar position to Oman. They visit continental big guns Japan with second assured, but needing points to ensure they become one of the elite quartet to advance. Regardless of the outcome in Saitama, it has been a remarkable campaign for Syria given the troubles in their homeland. Singapore, who are assured of third, will bid farewell to coach Bernd Stange when they meet home side Afghanistan, in a match being hosted in Tehran.\\nA third match being played in Tehran is perhaps the most crucial of all with second in Group Fon the line as Iraq host Vietnam. Runaway leaders Thailand dominated the group, but neighbours Vietnam can unexpectedly join them if they somehow conjure a win over the 2007 Asian champions.\\nGroup G sees Lebanon seeking a big win over the ever-improving Myanmar as they scramble for a possible best runners-up ticket. The Cedars will need to recover their zest after conceding an injury-time defeat against Korea Republic on Thursday, in a result which may ultimately prove costly.\\nFinally to Group H where Uzbekistan and Korea DPR chase automatic progression. The Uzbeks, boasting strong home form, can retain first with a win over the visiting Bahrain. Korea DPR, who sit two points adrift, face a challenging trip to meet Philippines having dropped two points against the *Azkals *earlier in the campaign.\\nThe player\\nUnited Arab Emirates’ powerfully-built attacker Ahmad Khalil has continued his rare form of 2015 into the current year. The 2015 AFC Player of the Year netted in Thursday’s 2-0 win over Palestine for his 11th goal during Russia 2018 qualifying.\\n*Did you know? *Australia have lost just one World Cup qualifier at home since 1981. Their only defeat came during the past 35 years came against China PR in 2008 as coach Pim Verbeek fielded an experimental side ahead of the Beijing Olympics.\\nThe quote\\n“Iran is still at top of the group and we want to advance to the next stage as the first team,”Iran coach Carlos Queirozremains focussed as his side prepare to host Oman.\\nMatchday fixtures\\n29 March\\nGroup A: United Arab Emirates-Saudi Arabia, Palestine-Timor Leste \\nGroup B: Australia-Jordan, Tajikistan-Kyrgyzstan\\nGroup C: China PR-Qatar, Maldives-Bhutan\\nGroup D: Iran-Oman, India-Turkmenistan\\nGroup E: Japan-Syria, Afghanistan-Singapore\\nGroup F: Iraq-Vietnam\\nGroup G: Lebanon-Myanmar\\nGroup H: Philippines-Korea DPR, Uzbekistan-Bahrain\\nRegulations:The second-placed teams in the five-team groups will have their results against the group's bottom side discounted to create an equal standing compared to Group F, which only has four teams.

       "   'content': \"Shinji Okazaki seems to have been walking on air over the last few months. Nimble, agile and a source of perpetual motion across the frontline whomever he represents, the Japan and Leicester City forward has been turning heads as the 2015/16 season approaches its conclusion.\\nHe was at his balletic best when he opened the scoring for Japan against Afghanistan as the  Samurai Blue secured a place in the next round of Asian qualify for 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia, a highlight of a campaign that has potential for plenty. The first of his season’s targets was wrapped up in what ended as a comfortable 5-0 victory for Vahid Halilhodzic’s side, but up until the former Mainz forward struck, the visitors had proved a tough nut to crack.\\nTurns out, all that was need was a little finesse. That is an attribute Okazaki has in spades, which he duly displayed to all watching in Saitama on his 99th Japanese appearance. With his back to goal on the edge of the area, he teased Makoto Hasebe’s pass into his path with a neat 180 degree turn, before bursting past his marker with a Messi-esque change of direction and cool left-footed finish. Seen on a loop, the goal takes on a mesmeric quality.\\n“We had some difficult moments in the first half, so my goal came at an important time,” he modestly explained following the final whistle.\\nThe game also saw Halilhodzic implement a front two. pairing Okazaki with Mu Kanazaki – a system the Leicester striker has shone this season. The system had been untested before the game and the Bosnian coach was delighted with the results. “That was a truly beautiful win,” he reflected after the game.\\n“At the beginning we were passing the ball a bit too quickly, and some of the players were trying to do too much. But overall our team played phenomenally well, with a new system which I had never tried before with them.”\\nFrom club to country\\nAllowing Okazaki to seamlessly bring his fine form from club to country certainly was a shrewd move. The now Japanese veteran – who stands as one of just two men to score at two different FIFA World Cups for the Samurai Blue – has been quietly making the difference behind Leicester's star performers, Riyadh Mahrez, Jamie Vardy and N’Golo Kante. His startling overhead-kick winner against Newcastle United was a brief step into the spotlight amid his more unsung contributions.\\nHaving developed his talents at Shimizu S-Pulse, then making a name for himself as a predator over five years in Germany at Stuttgart and Mainz, he now finds himself sat at the top of the English Premier League – something he readily admits is a new experience.\\n“In the past, I’ve never been part of a championship run like this, so for me this is a great experience,” he said, with the Foxes currently five points clear. “I have team-mates who have produced great results and are very hard-working and supportive, which is a good combination. And it’s great to be part of such a team that is at the top of the league.”\\nHis five goals this term have helped them to claim a crucial 13 points and, as he explained, their progress has been followed keenly in Japan. “People are paying attention and took notice when I signed with Leicester,” Okazaki said. “I think it’s become a big thing back home.”\\nSet to mark his international century against Syria on Tuesday, he’ll no doubt be keen to add to his tally of 48 goals for his country and return to England’s midlands with the wind firmly in his sails.\"},\n",

They will, over the course of two forthcoming matchdays, receive the company of another six section conquerors and four best-placed runners-up in the final round of Asian qualifying for the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™.\\nAppetisingly, the top two in four pools will clash on the final day. First, though, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, Australia and Jordan, Iran and Oman, and Japan and Syria must avoid unforeseen slip-ups at the penultimate hurdle. That is when Thailand, the Pot 3 outsiders who are five points clear, require just a draw against Iraq in Iran. Anything less, however, would agonisingly leave their opponents as the favourites for the pool’s automatic ticket.\\nLet FIFA.com take you on an extended tour of Thursday’s 15 fixtures.\\nThe big game\\nIraq-Thailand\\nOthers know them as ‘The War Elephants’. Their fans call them ‘The Barcelona of Asia’. And it is with that tika-taka style that Thailand have defeated the higher-ranked Vietnam home and away, taken six points off Chinese Taipei, and scored two late goals to hold Iraq in Bangkok to leave themselves a point away from the unthinkable in Group F. Getting it against Iraq is, nevertheless, a big ask. The Mexico 1986 participants may be ‘hosting’ the game in bordering Iran, but they boast players of the calibre of Udinese’s Ali Adnan and the evergreen Younis Mahmoud. Iraq are at home to Vietnam on the final day, so Chanathip Songkrasin, Theerathon and Co head to Tehran knowing they will probably need a result. Will they get it? It is anyone’s guess, but it will be fun watching the pass princes try.\\nThe other attractions\\n*Saudi Arabia head second-placed United Arab Emirates by three on points and goal difference in *Group A, and both are expected to beat respective visitors Malaysia and Palestine. The Green Falcons, for whom Saeed Al-Owairan scored arguably one of the greatest goals in World Cup history at the RFK Stadium in Washington, will nevertheless be out to outscore the UAE and effectively clinch top spot before the Persian Gulf rivals clash in Abu Dhabi.\\nIt is a similar scenario in Group B. Australia and Jordan, who are two points off the pace, square off in Sydney on the final day. First, however, they must avoid stumbles at home to Tajikistan and Bangladesh, respectively.\\nChina may be three points behind Hong Kong in Group C, but they have reason for optimism in the race to finish as runners-up. The Korea/Japan 2002 participants have a game in hand, a superior goal difference, and host a Maldives side they overpowered 3-0 away, while their rivals visit free-scoring Qatar in their final outing. The Chinese entertain the Qataris on the concluding matchday.\\nOman may only be three points behind Group D leaders Iran, whom they still have to play, but their vastly inferior goal difference means they really require an unlikely Indian favour in Tehran. The Reds, for their part, entertain Guam in Muscat.\\nJapan and Syria both won 6-0 away to Afghanistan and Cambodia respectively. The emperors from the east and the emerging Eagles from the west will be expected to cruise to victory in the return fixtures – results which should send both through in Group E.\\n“We may be through, but we still want to advance with maximum points and no goals against,” said Uli Stielike ahead of his Korea Republic side’s Group G swansong. That was discomforting to Lebanese ears, with Miodrag Radulovic’s team having ground to make up in the battle for best runners-up slots. Kuwait’s final two games will not unfold due to the FA’s suspension.\\nUzbekistan are one point beneath Group H leaders Korea DPR and boast a superior goal difference heading into their game in hand. A comfortable friendly defeat of Lebanon last month took gave the White Wolves a sixth successive victory, and they will expect to breeze past Philippines, whom they thrashed 5-1 in the sides’ last encounter, and leave their destiny in their own hands. Bahrain and Yemen meet in the other contest.\\n*Player to watch\\n*In their quest for goals, the Saudis will be delighted to have *Mohammad Al-Sahlawi *leading their line. The 29-year-old has thrived over the last two years, and has hit 22 goals in as many internationals.\\n*Did you know?\\n*Andrei Piatnitski, having already represented Uzbekistan, played against eventual champions Brazil at USA 1994. Server Djeparov, the White Wolves’ long-time poster boy, can at least boast that his son is named after a man who scored in three World Cups: Raul. Ironically, the Spanish icon also named his first son after a footballer: Jorge Valdano, whose goal helped Argentina win the Mexico 1986 Final.\\n*The quote\\n*Kiatisuk Senamuang, Thailand coach: “Nobody gave us a chance at the start. Now we’re on the verge of making it. We’re not afraid of the Iraqis. They need six points while we only need a draw. We’ll be going for the win though – that and playing attractive football are things we believe in.”\\nPenultimate matchday fixtures\\n*24 March\\n*Group A: Saudi Arabia-Malaysia, United Arab Emirates-Palestine\\nGroup B: Australia-Tajikistan, Jordan-Bangladesh\\nGroup C: China PR-Maldives, Qatar-Hong Kong\\nGroup D: Iran-India, Oman-Guam\\nGroup E: Japan-Afghanistan, Syria-Cambodia\\nGroup F: Vietnam-Chinese Taipei, Iraq-Thailand\\nGroup G: Korea Republic-Lebanon\\nGroup H: Uzbekistan-Philippines, Bahrain-Yemen\\nRegulations: The second-placed teams in the five-team groups will have their results against the group's bottom side discounted to create an equal standing compared to Group F, which only has four teams.
